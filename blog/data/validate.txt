0	I thought I was slick. I thought I had the wool pulled over everyone's eyes. Amazingly, the one person I didn't think would figure it out, in one brief horrifying moment, exposed the best laid plans of mice and men..or the best hidden thoughts of Kaige anyway.  It was a bit like spending a lot of time hiding easter eggs, and having someone walk in and find them all in 30 seconds.   Luckily, I trust him completely, so I'm not worried.  Just a little shocked, and embarassed.
0	With election day upon us, I have casted my vote and now I wait, but first I received a rejection letter in the mail from the Clarkston News. I guess there is nothing left keeping me in michigan now...
0	Wow....this is crazy that we only have a couple days of school left...I guess its kinda hitting me hard.  I learned last night that you can not trust anyone.  I give so much to only learn that I'm shit on in the end. Fuck life.    My bestfriend does not even want to hang out with us anymore.... I learned that I lost two friends last night  I wish I could go to sleep for a couple days and everything would be find when i wake up..........
1	This community is brand new. I just finished modifying it. I'm still trying to learn. I'm still learning about lj because I'm new to this.   I hope I get people to join in
0	i can't find my killing joke cd anywhere. i hate it when things just disappear for no reason.  my dad is starting radiation in august. hope it's effective.  really getting settled in at the new job, already feeling like home. i'm going to have to jiggle the days off a little bit. maybe work mon, wed, thurs, fri, sun. makes going out to clubs twice a week a little more difficult with my mon, tues, thurs, fri, sat work week as it is now. not too bad, tho.  ah well. back to sacto. no tunes to listen to again.
1	This is from a session we did a while back.  It was never posted to her site.  I'm not crazy about the lighting and the angle isn't exactly what I wanted, but I LOVE how she is standing/posing.  Something about it makes my motor run...   Not a day goes by that I don't marvel at how beautiful she is.   
1	Out of the blue today I was IMed by two friends from elementry school.  We had stayed in touched through middle school and after I moved, but I haven't hung out with either of them in about two years.  Apparently, they talked about having a sleep over like we used to and catching up.  I would have used to feel uncomfortable about this; randomlly meeting up with people who are basically strangers now,  but I am really excited to see them and find out whats going on with high school, college, ect.    On another note, Fishman '05.  I was kinda pissed, but am over that.  It's camp, it'll be fun.
1	Today was awesome.  I got to see Stacey Murrill at Kroger's today with the hottness that is her boyfriend, Kevin.  I got to talk to Matt for a little bit today, and he made me happy.  And I definately cut my hair!! Check it out. =) And you know what else!?     Kaity and I are going to go see Taking Back Sunday in Columbus on November 5th!!!!!                       
1	Went to the greyhound track tonight and I did bet on about 4/5 races and I won about £30.. jesus.. i never win...so I'm well happy! :D  Jo paid for my bday present today and so I got my ear pierced £28 with solution, it fucking kills but I like it :D :D :D :D
1	OK, so I am back playing again, and I am very happy about it. I'm also very happy that we won the other night, and that I got to celebrate with Bruno. Of course, I'll take any reason to celebrate with Bruno...
0	I have declared love cannot happen If it can, then it cannot happen for me Love always finds a way to screw me out of things No drug or lie can disprove the fact She never really wanted me after all  If love cannot happen, then what is life? A cruel blank sheet waiting to fuck you again? If that's so then i say goodbye, good riddance, For i have no proof to prove my accusation otherwise  If love can tease so harshly, then what is the hype about it? I find everytime i think i know something about it It turns around and bites me in the ass If love is hopeless for me, then i guess so is life  So again, goodbye, good riddance A tease can kill a man, if you want proof Look at me.
1	red sox are going to the world series and they will win it....and when they do win i am sure everybody that was rooting for ny will try to jump on the band wagon,but we don't want you p.s. i love you jamie,thanks for another great night and 2 months of happiness
1	Ahhh.....only a few week left of school!!!!!! Its sooooo nice outside! Today was sooo great! I got to eat lunch with all the great people from southeast. I always feel so much better after talking to them. God has been breaking me in so many ways recently. its really crazy to see how things work. I still struggle daily with things like eating, but I now have people I can turn to for help and to lean on. Im also trusting in God for his help so much more than before. Im no where near where I want to be, infact I hate it that I still have the thoughts towards eating that I do, but I know I have definatly improved! Well....off to go run! Later:)
0	So okay.. i just want God to understand that i really believe the quote "fate is in your hands", and i do believe i can change my fate if only i put an effort to it. But i guess God already know anyway right? He knows everything, so how could i deny Him. Sometimes i question whether the effort to fulfill my fate is a test or a sign that it will never happen or i will have another fate. Surely i always (well, 89% of it) think it's a test. Until i get all bruised up inside and still think that God will never bear any obstacle more than what i'm capable of. But really, is it to say that i can get through it or "just forget about it, this is not for you"? I'm so confused about those two. I think it's all in my head. I believe what i want to believe. And i believe in karma. I believe in good will. And i certainly believe in God.
0	y'know, this easter might have been alright if i could get those last few minutes of the game out of my head. i can't remember the last time i was this crushed over a basketball game. oh, wait, yes i can -- when uk was beaten out of the elite eight two years ago. i wish i hated sports. and now i'm off to light myself on fire  close

0	 there is nothing left inside of me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all i feel is empty...its been a shitty day... lets recap... found out that i'm most likely not going to prom. failed my senior project paper. got bitched out by my world lit teacher. couldn't go to the mall. failed a film studies quiz. yelled at by my mom for a messy room. got yelled at by my dad for having 7 books overdue. finally excited to finally relax and watch the oc... i have to babysit.... fuckin not my day i dont think i could be in a worse mood right now.    i'm sick of talking about prom. its fuckin annoying 
0	I was half-asleep when I wrote the review of Supermegatopia for RPGnet, and it's going to show.  One sentence:   Avatar, an unfortunate girl who channels the randomly powers and personality of gods (one week Hera, a few days as Sopha, a weekend as Jehovah...).   Can YOU spot the sleep-deprived errors?
0	You know - why do we all feel we need to know things? Why can't we just go through life with unknowns to all things, accepting our daily things as just that day - not anticipating the worst of the worst or being disappointed by those expectations not met? Ignorance is definitely the best way to go...look at children - they are completely content until they learn stuff...then the whining and crying begins - then comes boredom and anxiety. What is that commercial...there's always matching pairs of socks, always enough icecream, never a rainy day on a picnic...but life isn't always perfect.
0	we live in a beautiful world and some people have such painfully beautiful souls that it makes you want to cry  I hope they will be truly happy later in life, because they deserve it.
1	YAY!!!!  My mom just called and said she's going to buy me a plane ticket to Vancouver!!!  We're going in June to visit my Aunt and Uncle and their new baby!!!  Woohoo!!!  Now, to make sure I can get the vacation time from work...
1	oh i dont know what to do. should my hair be curly or straight for the wedding? tell me what you think. i should be working on my paper, but i'm thinking about the wedding. weeee! ok, bye bye now.
0	1.  I missed my exam today and I doubt the professor will allow me to make it up.    2.  I am sick.  3.  I feel like no matter what I do I will never make her proud of me.   I am failing the class which I missed my exam in. But I would rather have a E than an I.  Also I am not in college for her but for myself. I am feeling better.  But right now I am just depressed but hopefully I will cheer up soon.
0	   NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Boone isn't supposed to die!!!!  *dies*  I cried so hard.  Really.  I've never cried over a TV show.  Well, I cry at Extreme Makeover Home Edition, but that doesn't count.  BAH!!!  *is upset*  OMG!!!  PREVIEWS!!!  What are they going to do to Locke?????  MEEP!!!!  Claire had her baby.  Yay for her.  I kind of wanted her to die instead of Boone.  Yeah, I'm mean.  But at least she has a healthy baby!!!  I wonder what she's going to name it.  *votes for Boone...or Ian, as a subtle nod to him*  Okay, now I feel like a total jerk because I'm being a baby over this when people close to me are in so much pain.  Sorry.
0	I feel phyically ill...god you'd think it would start later this week... I just have to try to not think about it too much...
1	so tonight i went to see Colin and Brad from Whose Line is it Anyway? perform. they were friggin hilarious. they were also very nice! i was surprised by the way they acted in a small group of people. Colin, mainly. he seemed a little shy.     incase you couldn't read the names.     i asked Brad to sign my shirt, he asked where and i pointed to where he signed. then he said to Colin, "Hey Colin, sign this young lady's shirt very carefully as her mother watches." and Colin looked at me real weird (in a humorous way) and signed with great caution. he seemed nervous about it. it was funny and really nice of them. some woman took a picture of me with them on her digital camera and i gave her my email address to send me the photo. im so happy she did that. yay. tonight was so much fun. i love laughing.   xoxo, manda
1	Last night was spent celebrating results with       molten_emma   , Alison, Megan and Rachael. We headed down to the three sisters. It was great. That was the first time I'd been there and I'll definitely go back. It was supposed to be cheesy Tuesday but it was all a lie. The music was great though all the same. We requested 'Take on me' which is 'our' song. We sang our little hearts out. A few of       molten_emma   's Watsonian pals were also there and they came and sat with us. However they weren't very chatty. I couldn't believe the number of tourists that were there though. The place was crawling with them. Twas lovely though. We left at about 1.30 even though the bar stayed open until 3am. Alison and Rachael had work today. Ugh. Will party in Dublin. Which reminds me I better go and get stuff ready.        molten_emma   , did you enjoy yourself last night? You're not on msn. *shocked look*
0	Crap. They think my little brother might have cancer. The doctors aren't sure yet, so my mom is driving him up to Denver tonight and they're going to stay at the Children's Hospital here. *sigh* I don't know what to think. I feel so helpless. I hate this feeling... just... pray for him or... whatever you do. Please. I'm scared. I can't even begin to imagine how my mom feels. How HE feels... *sigh*
0	Not sure how I feel about the whole Terri Schiavo case.  I have a healthy respect for life but in this situation there has to be some realism and I think that the choice to stop feeding her was the one needed to be made.  I don't want to say it was the right choice or a good choice but as I said it "was the one that needed to be made."  Even the glimmer of hope, the impossible hope of a miracle, would not have resulted in a life that anyone would really choose to live.  May her family greave in privacy and may she rest in peace.
1	HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANGELA!! I LOVE U SOOOO MUCH!! UR SUCH A BIG GIRL LOL!! THE BIG 16!!! YAYA!!!!!!! I HOPE ITS A GREAT DAY! i had fun with u last night!! EVERYONE WISH HER A HAPPY B-DAY!! THANKS! &lt;3 u!
0	Both are methods of cleansing. As many of you know, there  was a fire at my house and yes, everything alive is still alive, including the hamster and fish, and nobody was hurt. Uppermost in my mind is, what is the purpose of this? Fires are cleansing and maybe we need that, a purging of unhealthy cycles and a beginning anew. Upstairs is an alien landscape, even the light bulbs melted. The microwave is an exercise in surrealism a la Dali. The two bedrooms are mostly untouched. Kia the hamster is ok even though the food sitting on top of her cage was burned. The floor is covered in ash. The pirate  shower curtain is a puddle on the floor with plastic stalagtites above. R's paintings have an extra dimension. It's art? Poor scarred beautiful house! We love you.
1	It's been a while since I really posted anything.  Most of my internet time has been sucked away by my brand new Neopet.  Yeah, I know, I'm like years overdue, but I just discovered the little guys.  I have a beautiful little blue Eyrie named Kawatori.  Hee hee.  GEEK.  Let's see... Had to buy new work pants today.  Mine finally wore away to shreds.  SHREDS.  You wouldn't believe it if you were standing there!  Miguel sent me Ferrero Rochers and 2 Angelic Layer mangas for Valentine's day, and I'm about to settle in and watch the copy of 'Hero' someone lent me.  In other geeky news I am in the last 200 or so pages of Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix.  Won't give any spoilers away to anyone who is actually slower than me in reading it, but WHAT THE FREAK!  Never has a book drove me so crazy with frustration.  My sister says it gets no happier, her bieng a complete Harry Potter fiend.  Edge of your seat!  EDGE!  To sum up:  GEEK.  SHREDS.  EDGE.
1	Three more days... i cant even take it.  Friday cant come fast enough.
1	Wufei, stop ignoring me in favor of your ridiculous RPG and answer my IM. I'm picking you up at 7:30 and then we're meeting Heero at his dorm before going to get Trowa. We're going to Bombay Garden, your favorite. It should be fun.
0	Had a weird / sad moment today when I picked up the mail.  I got one of those official notices from the Social Security agency and it came addressed to "MaryEllen O'Cain".  Sigh... I guess I should change my name with them.  It's changed everywhere else but for some reason I never changed it with them I guess.   It's still sinking in I think.
1	I'm licking a monkeys foot. O.o  No, really, I am. :D Instead of a big chocolate bunny for easter, my dad got me a big chocolate monkey. &gt;_&lt; It's very good.  Right, so. :D Much fun. Just got out of a conversation with Gabi (whom rockes muchly) and, but of course, Jeanne (who also rocks very muchly). ^-^  Am happy.
1	OH MY GOD!I've gotten soo super lazy and haven't updated for a zillion years.Ok, well YIPEEEEEEE today's my birthday!Yay...and ahh (birthday beats), Ashleigh beat me up in gym.Lol.Anyways,I've been having a download fest and was downloading lots of songs.Yay!We (meaning my family and I) just got back from a Thai restaurant (yummy). Well, gotta go, time for cake.  bye 
0	It is my own fault, I know; I should not have expected  anything different . I should know as well, if not better than any other Maeglin's reluctance to trust. I should not have expected to be different.  And yet ... I hoped.  But this was a  fear  that began long before me.  Perhaps I am wrong to demand his trust while I myself am still plagued by  doubts  and  suspicions . The only way he shall come to know true faith and intimacy is if he is shown it. So I shall strive to do, and deny him nothing.
1	Merry Christmas!    p.s. I made it home safely *wink*wink*  hehe
1	Happy V-Day!  I love you all. :D  *happy, waggy, wolfy hugs and kisses for everyone!* :D

Dancin' little marionette  Are you happy now?  
1	a housewife was so pleased with the promptness shown by the grocer's boy that she asked him his name. "shakespear" replied the boy.  "well this is quite a famous name", said the lady.   "it should be. i have been delivering in this neighbourbood for almost three years now."
1	was a lot of fun. i enjoyed myself. a lot of people were drunk. girls made out with girls...girls made out with boys. . . it was fun.

1	Wow. Things have been pretty quiet in the land of livejournal without Marik and Pegasus. Oh, and with Yugi being sick and Atemu taking care of him.  Malik told me that Isis now has a livejournal. That's great! Maybe now he won't be  as  homesick as he was feeling.   Hi Isis!
1	I really really want two avatars for my LJ...   One would be a moving Eeyore, the other Vamp Willow. I absolutely adore both of them for  very  different reasons. So if there is anyone out there who can help I'd be most grateful.

1	Life has been fine.  I'm a little sick now.  I have lots of work.  I've done 1 of 4 exams.  My last exam is the 21st.
1	You take a piece of fruit out of the oranges and lemon mix box. Say its an orange then that box has to be the orange box cos they are all labled in correctly so it cant be a lemon box.  The lemon box therefore has to be the mix box and the orange box is the lemon box.  If u get n e of that.  Well, that gave ur brain a good work out didnt it.  vicky says queer fish  It is the last day of term. WAAAAHHHAAAAYYYYY!!!! Merry Christmas to all in case i forget to tell u all nearer the time.

1	Well first off HELLO, I haven't written in a very long time.  I have a lot to say so pardon the long entry.      Well first off, I have someone important in my life right now. He makes me very happy and feel great about myself.  He is a keeper for awhile.  I really miss him and being around him. If anyone would like to know who this mystery guy is ask me!!!      I think I really care for him alot and that kinda scares me, I don't know if I am ready for something as serious as a relationship yet; but then again you never know until you try. I really want one and I am in one right now but it stills scares me or atleast it will until I am ok with everything emotionally. I hope it is soon or I might fall apart waiting for me to be ok and I don't want to hurt him at all!!!      Ok I know there is more but I can't remember it right now so I will write again when I can.
0	Today,..ah, today. I talked Jess into going to play some DDR. Which wasn't to hard a feat to do. There is no such thing as peer-pressure. *No one can make you do what you don't want to do.* We had fun and just at the end of our lil DDR session. Who should appear but one of my favorite victims: Carol.   We had fun the three of us. We keep picking on him, telling him, his dancing was as pretty as a butterfly. Then, we got into a weird conversation, me and Jess, about suicide butterflys and how they fly straight into your car. *It's bad Karma to kill things**I have enough bad Karma to kill myself let alone getting more* Ya, our butterfly conversation started to mess him up. He almost failed "Spin the Disc". Then he tryed to play Paranioa Survivor on Oni in dedication to me and Jess. He failed, but me and Jess felt appreciated. ;)  I think he had fun to, until we took his things...
1	found a new place to spend entirely too much money eating sandwiches.  AND they involve smoked salmon.  good god!        avitab    and i ate at this place on spring st. last night AND she paid.  excellent.  then she had her meeting and gets to do the play she wanted to do which is lovely.  she got to my apartment after that and we were discussing what we should do/deciding to watch a movie when       bandy    called to see if i wanted to see Lost and Delirious.  so we walked over there to watch and it was fucking hilarious.  stupidest movie ever.  not EVER.  just ever.  it was a great time.  and then i had to sleep.  and now i'm here.  good story huh? this morning the date was set for the a cappella auditions.  next thursday.  week from today.  i'm so excited.  i can't wait to have a group!
0	So yeah, The Village is pretty weak, or so I thought.  I can see how some people would like it though.  Being purposefully vague, I just felt pretty cheated by the ending, but I could see other people saying that it is clever.  My advice would be to wait for a rental.    .  Not to mention all the stupid motherfucking assholes in the theater who couldn't SHUT THE FUCK UP.  Laughing at every serious part, shouting instructions at the characters on the screen, cell phones ringing... sigh.  Miami is full of idiots.  On the plus side I got to meet       gurgle    and       marioandretti    and their friend whose name escapes me at the moment, sorry.  Hopefully next time we can actually hang out and chat and stuff.  Well, that's it for tonight.  Laytah.
0	So, no way I'm gonna top last entry, what with the pictures and all. I think that's the most feedback I've had so far. . . Kinda sad.  Oh well, so yay for not watching the superbowl except on commercials and watching the puppybowl instead. heh, if you missed that gem of a program, then your life is incomplete my friend.  Ugh, I need a new background, but I'm way too lazy and unmotivated to do one right now.  Back in Chi-town for the next semester, excited about that.  Blegh, really in an odd mood tonight, so before I ramble on about nothing I'll be on my merry way.  cheers    by the by, really wanna change my little emoticon dudes too. . .
1	Finished revising Chapter 4 of The Long Road.  I really hope to get two more chapters done by Monday.  *crosses fingers*  I've gotten back into the groove of this story and I do know what I want to do with it, so I think that I can finish it over break.  Hopefully, that isn't just wishful thinking.  But, off I go now - dinner time!
1	 My two Nightwalker DvD's arrived today. I had a spazm and watched the first one, and 2 episodes from the second. I'll get around to watching the rest later.  I went ocer to Faust's today yet, again I forgot to bring over Ringu. I now have a few bumps on my head becasue of forgetfulness. Heh.  Well I'll be off now, my mom wants me to go to bed. 
1	My husband is wonderful!!  A coworker of his is lending me  Feel !!!!  I get it today!!!  YAY!!  By the way, has anyone heard anything about Robbie in concert?  He or someone on the radio said summer 2005 -- but I haven't seen anything yet.  A new CD out too.  Anyone?

1	 Broadcasting House  is brilliant. Definitely worth waking up on a sunday for.
0	I will never get a handle on school.  I will graduate a mediocre student and no one will ever hire me for a grown-up job.  And by that I mean a job I actually feel proud of.
1	Work wasn't so good but it passed finally. Wonder if we'll get warnings for non-productivity again? Best not. I   will   have things to say. And they will like none of them.  On the other hand...  My hot little hands have Xenosaga II in them now. (Haven't played yet but will.)Luck was with me there. I bought the last copy that Target had. Yay, me! Also got the warmed up digits on the Greatest American Hero set. Not the last but getting there. Must be more people then me that remember this show.  And I finally found Naruto 5! B&N had it, also the last copy in the store. For those that need to know it covers the Rock Lee - Sasuke fight and the written part of the Chunin exams. It also shows right up to where they enter the Forest in the second part of the exams. Next volume will be in - - - - - April?!? Hope it doesn't take me as long to find it as it did this one.  Will relax this weekend or die trying!!!

0	Jimmy leaves for the coast guard..we had a little celebration at the ale house for him.I got to say my goodbyes to him in the parking lot.nearly crying,then actually crying. we talked about missing eachother and he made me promise to write and what not.A very long long hug and then a kiss goodbye.He told me to call him before they shut his phone off on wednesday..I will just to give a few words before he leaves...I'll miss that guy very much.I told him to be safe and not lose sight of everything he is and know that everyone back home believes in him.I know I do...bye jimmy
1	Guess what??? Yes, I know I'm excited but there's more. Drum roll please...  Damn it, everyone's in bed.  I'M MOVIN' TO THE CITY!!!  Yes, that's it but it's big for me. Driving for an hour (not even in peak hour) has taken it's toll and I've decided to take the big leap. I'm sure it's the right decision. I'm sure It'll all work out. At least I won't wear out my welcolme at the Fortress now.
0	these past 2 weeks have been the world shitting on me..nothing seems to flow my way..i try..but things just don't work out no matter how much i wish they could..court on wednesday for my speeding ticket..one thing that no one can know..which i wish i could scream out loud..i feel so awkward everywhere now..i don't feel whole like i used to..i've been smoking way too much lately also..around 2 and a half packs a day..and don't ask me why i'm up at 7am on my day off..i wish i could tell her everything and have it all the same again..i just wish i could travel back 2 months ago..things were so good..things felt alright..
0	Just when I start believing in the human race (Americans in particular) I read something like this. I have spent so much time defending Americans people in other countries; that we're not all selfish, not all ego maniacs, we're not all disrespectful or evil. Then this comes along. I signed the petition, not that it will necessarily do any good, but at least my voice will be among the thousands wanting to be heard.  I am at least thankful that I am surrounded by intellegent, caring individuals.   http://www.petitiononline.com/endhate/p etition.html 
1	Right now, looks like Tats is soon arriving to Boise, according to the timetable. The first of her flights begins at 8 AM local time. From my end, it's a bit less than twenty-two hours until we see each other again, and this time she won't have to go away in a few weeks or so.  She's going to  stay  here. I'm all boggled. o.o   And after she's here, there's a couple of weeks' worth of bureaucracy to deal with. Probably less but it's good to overestimate it so we'll have free time! Well, between my going to work, anyway, as my work hours range from roughly 3 PM to 9:30 PM, plus half a hour of walking back home. And that's not counting in the time I have to spend cleaning the place up after use.  But anyway! This is quite something. I've done lots of preparations already, including filling the kittybox for Izzy. I think I need to go to a grocery store and pick up some foods for us, the fridge is a bit on the desolate side.  I can barely wait for tomorrow.
1	I watched the  SpongeBob Square Pants Movie  the other night.  It was okay.  One part that I found amusing was the end of the movie.  Stop reading if you don't want the ending spoiled.   The plot of the movie is that Plankton (the bad guy) takes over Bikini Bottom using mind-control helmets that he tricks all the Bikini Bottom citizens into wearing.  At the end, SpongeBob saves the day by using the power of Rock.  He releases everyone from their mind control helmets by the power of his guitar licks, like in an old heavy metal video from the Eighties.  All the while, the villain is saying stuff like "His Chops are too righteous! The helmets can't handle this intensity of Rock and Roll!"   For some reason I found it absolutely hilarious!
1	Sooooooo I got my media project idea for my Religion in Lit and Media class approved!  I am going to do it on religious themes within Les Mis (the novel of course) :D  My teacher said that he has a list of books for the project and he would have put LM on there, but it's so big XD  We were discussing various types of religious themes today, and when "Redemption" came up naturally I said "Les Misérables!"  ... Everyone except for my friend kind of stared at me, but, okay.  We also brought up "inner moral struggle" and I said Jane Eyre... again, to which everyone except for my friend was like "o_o"  Whee XD  I'm also doing a presentation/paper on Juan Perón (I had to trade topics, but I got it!  Whee!) for Spanish class.  So apparently I'm going to have a very musical-related term :D  Doing research on Perón really gets Evita songs in my head. Like the other day I read up on the G.O.U. and got the The Lady's Got Potential in my head, so I had to listen to Evita in the car XD
1	Got my original japanese Tamagotchi "plus" today! Now I'm not only feeding-slave of four dwarf mice, but also of a  very  demanding, digital person which I could only hardly understand... ;) Hm... just selecting every option and see what happens... :-P   Let's see how long my current fascination will last, before it starts to catch dust somewhere in a cupboard :)      ...and it beeps again... sorry... "Coming...!" ;)      &nbsp;&nbsp;-Br&ocirc;gon
1	I got my new Phone!! A brand new GOLD ericsson T68!! Wahoo! I'm the first person in Australia to own one! *smiles, takes a bow* :P
1	So, I was sitting here, trying not to feel a little deflated that the recruitment office that told me that they had 52 positions that they needed to fill, and which I would undoubtedly do well in wrote me an email saying that they had nothing which fit my experience, interests, and skills, I got an email from a chiropractic office saying that if I wanted an interview, I should email back.  So I did. :)   As she's packing her things,  As she's spreading her wings,  The front door, it slams But the back door, it rings. And Smokey sings, he sings...    - ABC,  When Smokey Sings  (Although I really shouldn't have to source that lyric considering that they're  only  my favorite band, and it's  only  their biggest US hit... :))  Bonus points to anyone (save       memologist   , who introduced me to the origins of the statement) who can correctly identify the exclamation I titled this entry with.

0	I miss my Andrew so much, it makes me sad to be here with out him, I don't know how i am going to make it through this term. I AM GOING THROUGH IT! I just wish I would get a letter from him, so far I have gotten two but they were both to me and Kristen and today Kristen got one that was just to her and I havent gotten one yet. Even Scotty got one that was just to him. :( Maybe he doesn't love me as much as them. Sigh...oh well I guess I will have to deal.  So anyway this is day two of school I had Critical Thinking and Media Studies to day. I really think I am going to like Media Studies. In a little bit I have American Lit before 1876...gah sounds boring. Then tonight I have Abnormal Psychology, that should be a good class...I hope.  So I guess I should go to Class. Sigh...so sad today. I just wish someone would love me
1	Tuck 5 Bay Leaves under your pillow on Valentine's Day                                 This is supposed to make you dream about                                  The person you are supposed to be with  Please don't ask me if this works I've never tried it so I don't know, anyone who wants to try this, Bay leaves are very easy to get, you can find them at the grocery store. I know it's not typical of me to put something like this on here, but I figured someone may get some use or amusement out of this. I really don't have anything else worth talking about so, see you guys later.
1	Off to the State Quiz Bowl Championship this afternoon (remember how awesome it was last year, Laura?)  My last QB tournament. I don't know if I'll cry or not. My All-Star, Wheaties box, Championship teammates are Jude, Lucie, Austin, and Josh. Because of these guys, I have great faith in the future of Quiz Bowl at St. Louis.   What a long, strange trip it's been. I'll miss the hidden soft drinks, the Jesus-vs.-Gandhi debates, the nicknames, the broken buzzers, etc.
1	Woot! I got Tekken 5 for the PS2 today! Awesome graphics, great music, tons of fighters, what more could ya want?   Wanna battle I'll take you on? Paul Pheonix still rules the Iron Fist Tournament.

1	Will be interesting to see how many people outside my family remember without reading this entry :P  Mother gave me a PS2, Father gave me a Movado watch. So far I'm very pleased. It's been a nice start to my 18th year (since 00:00 I was chatting to random people at X, seeing old faces and enjoying myself)  Got to play the organ for the Divine Mercy of Medjugoria (sp) later, hence why I didn't get hammered last night. Then family party, can't wait.   See ya! xx
0	Someone is direct linking something  If you use up all my bandwith not only will the icons not be viewable but some of my friend's live journal layouts will also not be viewable.  And that's really unfair to them.  So I'd appreciate it, if whoever is direct linking my icons and or graphics would please stop.

0	Daniel goes over with the silly present he got for David and hm, some random good alcohol. He's not sure he feels like celebrating anything but it's this or curling up somewhere and crying.   Spending time with David is  a much better choice. David cheers him up.  He waits a bit before ringing the doorbell and offering a wane smile for whoever answers.  "Is it hard to adopt Russian babies?"  Maybe he should just be a single parent of some Russian girl. Well, and Mike too. Mike's a good kid.
1	Well, yesterday was the great hunt for a prom dress and no luck!! Jebus. I can't believe that I didn't find one. Oh well. I'll just have to have the hunt part deux.   TONIGHT! PAINTING THE FLOOR!!

0	I am watching  Philedelphia  on TNT right now. I love this movie, but it is so sad. I'm glad in my personal relationships, homosexuality is acceptable. But I hate how when I exit my perfect bohemian world, homophobia and hate prevails.  Tom Hanks is a terrific actor. And even though I like to feign being unemotional about such situations such as death and disease, I have the feeling I am going to cry at the end of this movie.

1	To celebrate my renewed vigour Carl, the barman is letting me perform a show in the club with all my hits. I may even do a few dance numbers...  Carl has been such a  darling  by putting out fliers, organinsing the food and such like. I've been rehearsing my routines in a back room.  I haven't had a drink in days I've been so busy.  It almost feels that I'm top of the bill again.

0	well Hope's gonna be pissed at me tomorrow.  I didn't print the essay I'm doing my catcher paper on and now the virtual library won't let me in it here at home.  So I'm here without an essay to do my paper on and I'm not sure what I'm going to do about it.  I guess I'll try to get to school early tomorrow or something.  possible pep band game tuesday, I haven't checked to be sure.  And Ms. Love said we were going to have a practice before district saturday but didn't say which day.
0	I am so fucking pissed off...no offense to any guys in particular but you all suck!  You guys fuck with our minds and then say we do it.  Take for example, my father, asshole...after 19, almost 20 years he realizes he's fucked up and wants to make our relationship better, or rather have a relationship.  As he puts it, he knows he's made mistakes but if I could have the heart to open up to him maybe we could have a relationship.  MY ASS!  Why now, why after almost 20 years...he's fucked me up more than he can possibly imagine and now he wants to try and make a fucking effort.  Again, why now?  I'm so sick of being treated like a fucking piece of shit, like I can be pushed and pulled around whenever a male god damn pleases.   Sorry offended anyone but I am sorely pissed off and ready to kill someone, most likely myself...
0	   Hey, everybody. School was so sad today. Brittany was so nice. I was so shocked when I found out. Last night at around 6:30 PM I wasn't feeling too well so I went to bed. I woke up at 4:30 this morning very refreshed and very much awake. My computer was still running and before I shut it down, I figured I would check all the away messages for fun. Well, there was nothing fun about what I read. This is all so sad. She was one of the "popular" girls in school who I didn't really talk to that much... but she really wasn't. Brittany was different. She was so nice to everybody and genuinly loved them. I considered her a friend of mine, even if we haven't spoken all that much. Such a nice girl, such a shame to lose her, a shame for the world to never know...    February 16, 2005...    R.I.P...    -MattyLac

1	8 AM. Cold. Tired. Off to Toledo. Catch you later, motherfuckers.
0	OMG, it takes for-ev-er to get your hair layered with a razor. If I’d realize that it was going to take an hour to cut my hair, i would have gone with a regular pair of scissors.   After a whole hour at the salon, I didn't even end up with the haircut I went in for. haha. My hair way too long, going like 5 inches past my shoulders, so I go in there to get it layered. When she cut off the first 4 inches, I was thinking, "okay, that's cool." Then she started evening it out and cutting more off. At that point I was getting worried. She didn't stop there. Oh, no. Then this story wouldn't so hilarious. She kept on going. 60 mins later, I end up with a bob. Whatever.   LOL I'll deal with it. I've gotten bad haircuts before.
0	I got an email from my mom this morning.  It said "We found CJ this morning near the same place we found her 18 years ago. She was buried this morning."  Although we had him 18 years and my mom didn't realize that it was a he.  We practically saved that cat's life when we found him.  He was in our back yard, almost dead, and we took him to the vet and got him taken care of and adopted him.  He was a damn good cat.    R.I.P. Chips Jr.  
0	the thing that hurts me so much is the missing my best friend. we've known each other for six years and i don't have any time on my phone and she doesn't have net access. she is concieted and eccentric and completely absorbed in her newly accuired husband. but i love her all the same. i really hope shes ok...

0	Well, glorious news here today on the PA front. I spoke with my doctor and got an x-ray.  The results: not exactly what I wanted to hear.  I have degenerative joint disease (pretty much arthritis) in my lower back and knees. The knees I have thought about for a long time, but the back was kinda surprising. In fact, he even said the back was a moderately advanced case.  And what can one do with DJD? Nothing, nothing I say! But it does explain a lot of things like why I have trouble falling asleep and why I have trouble waking up (see, I'm not lazy--I'm just falling apart).  The people here at work are having a field day with it. I already got an "Old Timer's Crossing" sign and a cane. Right now, this is hilarious. But I'm sure when it hits again, it won't be. Ah well, enjoy things while you can.   There go my plans for jumping out of a flaming building with only a rope (no, wait, that was a flashback from Ladder 49).  Peace. I'm outta here.

1	Yay! Fay is back...I think! ^^ And Sunny has been talking to me more often...Now only Cat hasn't been contacting me...I'm starting to worry about her ;-; I hope she is ok. I think I'll write her another e-mail and see if I get a reply this time. Life is pretty boring without Fay, Sunny, and Cat....But I have people who keep me happy while they are gone. My friends Neokai and Arctik call me almost every night and then there are the people in the chatrooms. And then I can play games aswell....and...um...I found a book! It's called The Secret Langauge Of Birthdays! It gives a description of people's personalities by the day they were born ^_^ I think I'll have to tell Fay and Sunny theirs. I told Neokai his, and a few people on IRC theirs as well.....I'm sorta bored now...I think I'll go talk to Neokai some more, or something. Bye! Love you Fay, Sunny, and Cat! ^______________^

1	 The Eleventh Annual Spring Beer and Wine Festival  takes place this Friday and Saturday at the Oregon Convention Center. The hours are from noon to 11 p.m. each day, and there is an admission fee (as well as costs for mug/stein/wine glass and tokens).  I looked at the brewery list, and there are several that I haven't heard of before. Plus some of the usual suspects have some new offerings--I am interested in checking out Rogue Brewery's Chipotle Ale.  In addition to beer and wine, there will be distilled spirits, food, music,  cooking demonstrations , and other fun stuff. A bit of warning--this festival tends to get crowded.
1	I got a vacuum!!! It kicks ass.  I'm in edmonton at the moment, and we happened to see a flyer for canadian tire, and they had the vacuum that I wanted on sale for a bit less than 200$.  I am so excited!!!! My old vacuum is getting tossed when I get back to calgary.  And then monday night..... I am cleaning.  I am so excited!!
1	I am finally becoming excited about Nutcracker!  A bunch of people have said they are going to come see me!  Even if it is kind of a crappy part.  Yay!  Just remember to get your tickets early, especially if you actually want to sit next to your friend.  It's getting difficult to get tickets in a group.  I am so going to miss everyone over this much needed Christmas break (especially those slackers who are leaving my classes next semester).  I kinda feel like with Nutcracker and all that I won't have a whole lot of free time which is a little disappointing.  No sitting around in my pajamas until 3 watching t.v.  Allright well, leaving now to do bookcards.  Grapes of Wrath= Worst Book Evar.

1	About to leave on a 60-80 mile ride.  It's not perfect out, temp-wise, but there's not a cloud in the sky.  Many miles to put in today.  Stopped at one of the shops I used to work at.  Got twitchy, just at the smell of things.  Can't wait to have one of my own someday.  But really really eager to get back into the racing this year.  Good stuff.  Before I forget:         Nair?  Fucking reeks, but it's faster than shaving my legs for the first time in the spring.  Also?  Can't ever get used to that first moment of jeans-atop-shaved-legs.  Too weird.
0	I seriously hate my father.  I don't even care what anyone says anymore.  He's broken his back, laying in bed, and bitching me out for eating a tuna sandwhich.  I really wish my dad would just leave me the fuck alone.  He comes home drunk and tells me b/c I have C that I suck!  I mean, you'd think he'd care his daughter is upstairs crying her poor little heart out b/c he doesn't love her, but Noooo....he goes back out to the bar!  I was soo hurt.  Well, he came back and Karma got him, cause he compressed a bone in his back.  I feel guilty, like its all my fault, but I can't control Karma...
0	wow, I feel like a total loser. It is the first night of spring break and I am already sick of it. I can see it now, I am not going to do anything because all my friends are in central wisconsin. Tonight, the highlight of my night was eating homemade stromboli, not like that is bad, but it just isnt exciting. I am also doing miserably in the dating world. I dont know if you could pay someone to go out with me as it is right now. not like I need a boyfriend but it certainly would be nice. I did get to play with my little ande tonight so that is good. I may go to chicago tomorrow, but I really dont know about that. It may snow or something and we really dont even have set plans so, we will see how that pans out. other than that, I have no idea.

1	And I WANT it!!! Good pay, short hours, GREAT work...the interview was at 10:15 and I was nervous and talked too much, but they were friendly and laid back. Kansas City Community College is a fairly long drive, but the idea of remedial education of adults to prepare them for the work place in an experimental program just tickles my everything. And Goddess knows I haven't had my anything tickled in so damn long it just feels funny...  Slaughter the goats and prepare to dance nekked or light candles or whatever your tradition demands. They decide by TOMORROW!!! Send whatever you have...energy, love, kisses...whatever works!

0	Okay, so its been awhile... a long while. School has been taking up a lot of my time.  I just wanted to make a quick post asking anyone who prays, to please pray for a very close friend and her family. She was killed in a car accident this afternoon and is survived by her husband and her four young children, all under 15 years old. It was very sudden and very tragic, and we would all appreciate any prayers.  thanks so much
1	k, i'm just letting you know now that this post has little if any point...don't say i didn't warn you.  not that she'll read this, but just as a general announcement to the world Mari is awesome.  went to the olive garden last night that was cool. saw shira and got to have a "lovely"  "conversation" with a hostile best buy employee. toured vons (?) and it was quite cold. and took a ride on the Hell-evator. and don't forget degrassi.  oh!!!! got my new phone today! el yay, i am sooo excited! now i have to set it up and stuff but it should be really cool and hopefully i'll be able to use it easily and well, lol.  the haverchat was cool and i'm really excited to meet new people and make friends. i still don't know how to contact Yun but we'll see.  is that it? hmmm, i thought i would have something slightly more than that, but apparently i've forgotten. oh well, i must go arrange travelness and stuff. and i just might post again if i remember. then again i might not. peace.

1	If you ever need to talk fashion with someone, Nate is a good candidate.
0	Mr. Quan is the little old Chinese man that lives next door to my mother.  He is really just Quan, but in an effort to help my sister be more polite, we all call him Mr. Quan.   One time, when I still lived with my mother, I had a party and some of us were out in the backyard enjoying our conversations.  Mr. Quan came out to his back porch and began to serenade us with his accordion.  My mom's boyfriend, Scott, and Kenny often went to Mr. Quan's house to help him lift heavy things and fix things he couldn't.  Mr. Quan, along with Mrs. Quan, would come over in the next couple of days with homemade egg rolls for the family, in appreciation.  Every Christmas the Quans would bring over tons of yummy treats for us.  This morning Mr. Quan left to run some of his errands.  He got just outside of the neighborhood and somebody ran into the side of his car.  He died.
0	I goofed around to much today, good thing I made my goal for the day early on.    Today I did 1600+ words. Total so far:   4133.   Not even half what I'd hoped to accomplish this weekend. Crap. If I'm lucky I'll get 500 each week night.  I'm going to have to try and beef that up a bit.
1	Finally, I completed my rear brake project!  The only thing left to do is to re-adjust the parking brake and tighten the lugnuts.  That should take all of 5 minutes or so.  I also saw the cause of my big shaking problem:  the U joints on the driveshaft were loose--town whore loose.  The nuts were virtually off.  That is something I will tighten tomorrow as well.  This should all render the car driveable, or at least to the shop, if the need arises.  I just feel like I am close to finally catching my white whale...  We did a lot of work on the house today.  The fence was mended some, despite the horrible job the previous owner did.  Chopped up some wood, too, so that we can get rid of it much more easily.  This week, we plan on working on our berry patches.  They need some love....  Time to go take a shower.  I still am covered in car juices....
0	Today I was woken up by something that sounded like an electric toothbrush, only 100 times more noisy and menacing.  Apparently, some construction guy was screwing a soap dispenser into the basment-level bathroom...this was at seven in the morning.  Generally, I set my alarm for eight and actually wake up around eight-thirty or nine.  Needless to say, I was not pleased.  And on the subject of not being pleased, why does no one stop by my room to visit me anymore?  For two weeks now, barely anyone has come by to see me.  Ista, Matt, and Kaoru all used to stop by on an almost daily basis, and now I only ever see them at meals or during class.  I miss them. T_T
1	I'm very happy :).  On another journal of mine, someone posted a reply to a review I wrote saying they liked it.  Made me very happy indeed :).  And they said they liked my icon!  *calms down a bit*  Right, other journal, I kindof went overboard on April first and made way too many livejournal accounts, including one for my PLANS.  Plans like, tree plans, or costume plans, or... perhaps plots involving tribbles and world domination.  So, here is my schemeing journal!!       calenmist    (psuedo elvish of course!)
1	I'm so happy... I got my new car today and it's really nice... it's a 1984 Maxda RX-7 and it runs great... it needs a tiny bit of TLC, but nothing is really manditory...
0	 Please pray for Chepe and her family. She passed away from a car accident; her sister Andrea's recovering from some injuries. :(

1	I got into grad school at USF...lalalalalalalala (I'm happy)
1	Hessian and I are off to New York today.  Fairady, I know you think we've already left but we haven't.  I've just been at Ron and Judy's in my sick bed all week and they don't have a computer.  I skipped class the past two days too so I haven't even been able to get to a computer lab.  Hessian is just lazy I guess.  I'm at work now. Dad and I have all the luggage in the car and we're going to pick up Hessian from school in an hour and he's going to drop us off at the airport.  Yay!!  I'm feeling so much better, I'm not completely well, but I don't hurt anymore and that makes it okay.  I can deal with being tired when all I have to do is sit on the plane.
1	Yay!  Today's my 2 month dating-anniversary :)  By the way, how long is it till most people stop doing the every month thing?  I'll probably keep doing it, I was just wondering when most people stop.         Your Linguistic Profile:       70% General American English     20% Yankee     10% Dixie     0% Midwestern     0% Upper Midwestern         What Kind of American English Do You Speak?    
1	Oh yeah...only an hour and a half left...well, less than that actually but round about that. It's way exciting. :) I can't even focus on this freaking homework that I procrastinated on doing. Saturday is the big party...woo hoo! Tomorrow also, Lynds said she wants to get me so drunk I won't be able to walk. Sounds like quite the hangover to me! :)  On the sad side, Justin leaves today. :( Six months is a long freaking time...actually, I guess it would be tomorrow but still. I'm gonna miss him like crazy, especially his drunken phone calls in the wee hours of the morning telling me all the things that he won't remember later that day. No one like him. Did anyone else know that Columbus Day is actually supposed to be on the 12th? It was totally yesterday but my philosophy prof insists otherwise...hmmm....he also saw elephants walking on the Lake Michigan beach one time...I never did decide if he was being serious or not.
1	I need to stop posting and get home, but before I go, the Google Maps Satellite feature vaguely creeps me out, but it's a great deal of fun at the same time.  I've been mapping my house, work, my commute, my parents' house, coworkers' houses, my dorm at school, a house I looked at this weekend, etc.  I never knew the bay was so freaky colored.  And boy, are houses closely crowded together here in the Bay Area.  This is cool. And weird.   Check it out  (that's my alma mater)
1	   HAPPY BIRTHDAY       karbear57         Wishing the best on your special day.            
0	i hate the way she makes me feel like shit with her words. she makes me hate myself to the extreme. because i know what she is sayin is true. his whole talk got me wondering. which one?! life is so wonderful in every way it hurts.wow. itll be so wonderful to move back to iran. itll just be briliant. i love how much my family loves me. and i absolultly love my life. i wish all this would just end. i jsut dont know what im suppose to do nemore. i  wish for a while i wouldnt have to think or worry about nething. i wish someone else would take over. like when ur playing a game. my turn would be over. fuck.    - new habit for me? briliant. fuck. i  must stop myself
0	This morning=Successfull.    in that I dropped off all my gifts to my Valentine before I left and I think it went rather well~&lt;3   They let me take the cake batter... THANK GOD T________________________T I've worked on this thing SO LONG. And I needed all these ingredients too for the snacks to serve at the wedding... BLESS YOU AIR PORT PEOPLE!!1!!1q  I have not slep for two days. i spent all last up up and cooking--what may be hopefully enough food for the crew. ALL NIGHT and almost all of yesterday. Very...very...time consuming.   What worries me is that i doubt iti's going ot be enough food, and eve if it is, they are going to eat it all in one day just because it is there. I DON'T WANT THEM TO STARVE! what am I going to do?!?!!!  And this AIRPLANE FOOD. I...What....  How can you serve this to peole?! This is going to get everyone sick, I''m going to their kitchen right now and talking to the chef!!
1	So, I called January a little bit ago.  It was so awesome to talk to her.  I've missed her.  I love so much that she hasn't changed.  She said several times that she thinks about me a lot, and misses me.  I get the feeling that she, as well as Laura and Rachel and I will be close for a long time.    Seems like things are going very well for her, which is awesome.  Sounds like she's finally getting internet access, which hopefully means we'll be in contact more.  And I feel bad I didn't ask how Tray is doing.  But hopefully no mention on her part is a good thing...  It just warmed my heart, as it does all the time, to have no doubt I am loved by her.
1	From what I hear, it might snow on Christmas Day.  Wouldn't that be awesome?!  Anyway, I'm done with Christmas shopping, so tomorrow I'm going to wrap everything, then go to a Christmas party at a friend's house.  I love Christmas.  It's awesome.  I just hope that everyone likes what I got them, cause I actually thought a lot about what they might like.  It all came from the heart at least.  In any case, I'm going to bed now so I can get up and work out with the "Man Maker" routine I do.  It's painful, but I get results.  Peace.
1	anyways ya i wish u luck tonight zeke at class...i hope u do good.anyways i was lookin through this victorias secret mag right and i saw some really cute things but when i looked at the price they werent that cute anymore.lol.it reminds me of california.i really wanna go dress shopping...or dress trying on and not buying...i just wanna go wear a pretty dress.plus banquet is coming up soon and it will be here before we know it.actually i just wanna go shopping.lol.i think im gonna get a pink dress this year or a blue one.idk someones gonna have to come with me and help me pick it out.i think pinks my new fave color.so ya last night i was talking to zeke on the phone and i wasnt paying attention to what i was doing and i ran into my plastic nightstand and it torn some of my skin off.it hurt and it still does.man i should be more graceful.lol.so ya it sucked going back to school today.i so didnt want to go back.oh ya and happy aniversary baby.i love u.
1	And, I'm off.    Here's to rest.  No, not really, my books are coming too!    But I'm away from home.
0	I'm done I cant stand it anymore. I'm just going to go about my life and do nothing. I've been hurt too many times and I'm done. I can't find anyone. It's the worst thing ever.   I know most of you wont know what I'm talking about, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.  Anyways I had pretty good day. I woke up went to work. I had this Arizona Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey and that was really good. It got me really hyper though which was awesome. Then my friends and I went to the mall and stayed there for about like 4 to 5 hours. Then I just came home. Then something happened which is why I wrote the thing on top.   I guess that's all for today.   Till next time.
1	It's amazing how good friends exes can be once both parties have moved past things.
0	ugh today was the worst day ever..so many bad things happened, and not just things in school, things with family happened too and im really upset and really worried. for once in my life my sister was actually comforting tho, so i owe it to her that im still together right now. its times like these that i wish i still had a bf becuase i now have to go thru it all alone. i just wanna go out tonight with laura and jess becuase they'll take my mind off of it. especially jess becuase shes crazy, lmao. well thats about it for today..leave one..laytah lovess &lt;3  xo- jewels
0	Right now I wish life could be different. I wish I had people to listen to me. But not even my supossed best friend who really isn't anymore didn't listen to me. She said my problems were petty and ridiculous. It's because she always tries to compare my problems with hers. You can't compare two different lifstyles together. Also she is telling me to let go of grudges when she can't even do it herself. I hate it when people don't practice what they preach, it's stupid. I feel alone even though I am really not. I have lost some friends and I don't want to lose anymore. I try to be the best person I can be but it isn't working. If my so caled friends can't accept me then what kind of friends are those. I believe I am a generally good friend and person. But one person doesn't see that. I am neglected by this person all the time and she doesn't realize it no matter how many times I tell her. I wish people weren't so stubborn.
1	Well....good News: I passed my Spanish Regents, no doubt. And another is that Angela is pregnant!! I couldnt believe it. When my mom told me, i thought my cat had died. But it was just that she is due in December. I cant see my uncle as a dad, man things are going to change. But i am so excited.    bad news: i cant get a hold of Danielle. she sleeps way to much! And i really want to know what she did, cause i am scared and she wouldnt tell me last night! Geez!
1	Well, it's that time of year again. I think that Christmas has become a little too material. I mean, the big focus is now on what you're getting for Christmas, not what you got. Yeah, I know it's easy to forget, I get caught up in all the hype too, but try to just take a couple of seconds to think about Him and all He did for you. Serious stuff aside, I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas and a Happy New Year. God Bless.  Nick
1	LOVE    GUITAR    CENTER!!!!! Seriously, it's the best.  The guys are awesome, I &lt;3 them all. And it's fun.  I want more hours.   My job makes me happy.

0	im a mess. a mess.  i havent taken a shower since sunday afternoon. it doesnt sound so bad on a monday night.  northstar broke up. i seriously have grown attached to that band over the last 10 months or so. im so sad. go listen to a song or download or acknowledge.they could have been huge. also recently scott the drummer of bleed the dream died of luekemia. i never really listened to them before but i went to pv.com and they are good. it's sad, he could have only been 25 or so. so everyone should go listen to a song.   dance dance, is a crazy FOB song. it's crazy, i cant say anything else about it.
1	 http://www.believermag.com/issues/20050 4/interview_mieville.php   My favourite quote-  I’m in this fucking business for the monsters. The monsters are the main thing that I love about the fantastic. And unfortunately, you can’t really sell books of monsters to publishers. They insist on stories linking them. 
0	    "When Tony--who was arrested for treason at the end of last season--reappears, he's hardly the same man. He spent a year in prison before Palmer pardoned him in one of his last orders of executive business. And he weathered a divorce from Michelle (Reiko Aylesworth, who'll also return). 'He's angry, bitter, pissed at the world,' says a clearly thrilled Bernard. 'I didn't want to come back and have it be the same boring thing.'"  TV Guide article   Tony pardoned = good news Tony + Michelle = DIVORCED NOOOOOOOOOOO! It can't be. Why? Why would she divorce him after he sacrificed everything to save her life??? Why would he be so stupid s to let her go????  Someone, pass me a drink.
0	There's no reason for me to be here right now.  He's gone for a week, although that's almost over, but I'm so lonely that I could be the only soul on the face of the planet right now.  I've managed to beat this back for a while, but it's not working now.
0	there's a great word..blah. it can describe just about anything for you. like now, i feel blah. sometimes i wonder if it's even worth it to wake up everyday. The person who means everything to me seems to make me want to cry more than anything. Not intentionally..just like well I don't know. Maybe all the little things are getting to me. I really just want to be right there with him. Sometimes I wish it weren't so complicated, but nothing good comes easily I guess. Then there's wonderful people who make it so much better and think what I say is pure bs to raise someone's hopes, or references to me being incapable of doing anything useful with my life unless I have them around to tell me what to do everyday for the rest of my life..whatever..
1	        I am such a loser.  Prime example - I'm about to go on a Latin field trip.    Love your Hannah
0	A half world away, a Tsunami struck and we all thought, Thank God it's not me and there is no one I know who got caught by it.  Well today the word has been let out here at work that one of my co-workers(a Friend) and his family may have been affected by the tsunami.   No one is able to contact him or his family.  Here's hoping Harpreet Singh and family are alive and well.
0	       I am  Centipede .   I wander back and forth minding my own business, changing directions only when things get in my way, but I always seem to be persecuted. It's as if people want to hurt me, to cut me in two, to laugh at my confusion. Can't you just leave me alone? Stop shooting me!  What Video Game Character Are You?     
1	I hate Valentine's Day. I know today isn't Valentine's Day, but i got home so late last night from the Thin Lizzy/Deep Purple concert. If it weren't for that this Valentine's Day would have sucked. The concert was awsome by the way. I went with Josh, Shy, and Jewl. They did all the songs i wanted them to. Thin Lizzy did "The Boys Are Back In Town" and Deep Purple did "Highway Star" and "Smoke On The Water". It was so funny. While Deep Purple was playing, a lady out of no where jumped up on stage and started dancing. Security came and drgged her away while she was thrashing. After the concert i slept over at Josh's house.
1	Compared to the weekend in the Swiss Alps...yes, I said the Swiss Alps, it's been very quiet. Claire and I had planned this trip for weeks, and I promised to treat her to a weekend at a spa. It's amazing what that can do to you. I'm a brand new woman.  Congratulations to Julia on her pregnancy, I am so happy for you!  My family has seemed to disappear. They don't call, fax, write, visit or anything. It sure would be nice to hear from them. Nevertheless, I love them.  Okay, that's it, short and sweet. I'm going to the bookstore.
1	today has been pretty ace, last night was fun. i taught lee and mark how to play poker cause mark has bought a poker set. woah, it was a right laugh, pizza, chips, beer, poker and low lighting. you can't beat it. franks fully cheated like, but it was funny when we rumbled him. he's all "oh, where did that card come from, i didnt know i was sat on these ace's" ahaha, tonight, erm... oh yeah, working on making my art folder look a little bit better, and start my costume design thing for just. oh, speaking of just, 5th april, 6.30, £2.50. im not gonna make anyone come, wanna ticket, have a word with me. wickes is whack.

1	I went in today for my second interview at Red Robin.  Guess who has a job now and starts this very Saturday??  YAY!  I know it'll impact on how late I can hang out at Paco's on Friday night - not too late.  :(... but I think it's worth it for the whole new job thing.  I want the weather to stay warm like this, but I heard on weather.com that tomorrow night is supposed to get to something like 35 degrees.  EW.  Oh well - at least I'll have money!  Yay!
1	How are ya!!!  Kinda looking back on all my posts and all my friends posts I realize we may use this forum a little too much to just vent, post about the crap in the world or just ramble drunk.  So 100% positive vibe tonight.  Ok, so a little positive buzzed vibe, but nevertheless, I just want to say HEY!!!!!.  I had a great day today.  Life was nice.   Desi - Hope India ROCKS!!! Obie - Hope London ROCKS!!! Durran - Hope Melbourne will ROCK!!! Benjamin - Hope being back ROCKS!!! Andreas - Hope having all you best friends in town this weekend ROCKS!!!!  and Danny - you better not let the hub crash this weekend....:)......double ellipse...:)  and for those of you who I'm not sure have my posts on your screen.  I sincerely hope your day tomorrow ROCKS!!!
1	Well, I have a little free time in MIA, so here I am. Just three more hours...then I'm free until April!  Oh yeah, remember that Helen of Troy thing that I had to do? I was actually one of the people who made it. I thought my poem was crap, but meh. The judges will agree with me on that. O.o

My luck has been shit for the last two months, and I need this to get back on my feet.   These have been the worst two months of my life. How have they been for you? Fuck.   - Your Pal Ritz

1	I am now going to try and be a sort of supergirl.  LOL  Here's what I mean.  I'm trying to get a petition started to change the laws and punishments for those people who abuse, neglect, torture or kill animals.  Or anything in between.  I'm going to get the whole school involved...hopefully.  I'm going to make a difference...hopefully.  Heh...see what I mean?  I'm hoping to get some information and see what I can do to change some things that I don't think are right.  I dunno, we'll see what happens, and I'll update when it's more than just a thought....

1	I wish you weren't grounded tonight. That look is beyond anything.Your every look is beyond anything. "it don't rain anymore" I had so much empathy for you at 4:30 am this morning, Darah McJimsey.  My reflection isnt worth your geometry.
0	It seems that today Cherry Atkinson has finally lost her fight against cancer.  Have a nice trip, angel. We'll see you in Summerland.  My deepest empathy to Derry, Andy, and all the family.
1	last night was really good. i love it when things work out.
1	So here I am, having lunch in Powell's. Rebecca had to come down to Portland to sign dome paperwork for her new job and I came with. I slept most of the drive down here so I didn't get to see anything really but I shall one the way back.  I'm definitely enjoying traveling with my dad's laptop. Makes this much more fun.  I haven't explored much in here yet but I already like it. It's as big as or possibly bigger than the Tattered Cover!
0	If you haven't a clue then you will probably understand that my problems are related to the last entries made by Darcie and Jason. I'm not angry at Darcie. At all. I'm just really depressed. A lot. I feel really sick. And I can't eat because of it. Why does life have to be unfair to me? Why not to some Nazi douchebag or some shit? Why is it always my calamity? Why my loving girlfriend of a year and seven months? It's just so overwhelming. And this constant feeling of vomit doesn't make anything better.  GODAMMIT! FUCK THE HAPPY HOLIDAYS. FUCK MOVING AWAY FROM YOUR WONDERFUL BOYFRIEND! FUCK THE BAD SHIT HAPPENING TO ME! FUCK BEING STRESSED OUT! FUCK DECEMBER 20TH, 2004! HELL, FUCK DECEMBER! FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!GHIJFAGHSAGHSAGDSHGLSDAGDSALGJKSGSL lhgalsdjadangersadness and shit.   Dammit.

1	TWO MORE DAYS UNTIL ME BIRTHDAY.  YAAAA.  THATS ALL.
1	my few reasons why christmas really sucks....  1. it virtually rapes your wallet 2. people turn into beasts when theyre shopping and driving 3. you have to spend boring time with your family 4. you (usually) get all excited for christmas to come and then boom! its done and you have to wait a whole frickin year 5. CHRISTMAS MUSIC 6. shopping for the people who have everything 7. getting presents that really suck and having to act happy 8. random siblings telling you what you got when you want it to be a surprise 9. wrapping paper and those boxes you have to fold... damn the boxes 10. everyones always out of town and you can never do anything when youre finally free 11. theres always christmas eve parties... never christmas parties, though 12. simply because eggnog is nasty 13. anything with fruit is bad. fruitcakes, baskets, etc. 14. crowded malls... crowded stores... crowded roads 15. putting the tree away afterwards  merry christmas you all
0	Why should I stay here?   I can't stop crying.  Things need to change.
0	 Fine be that way.     Jesus Christ. How did this all occur.     Okay fine. fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine. Since I'm soooo confusing and I'm sooooo weird I guess that I'll just&nbsp;blabber on and on and on&nbsp;okay? Hm do you people want to hear about it? Hm do you all want to know what&nbsp;I go through? Well GREAT.&nbsp;Oh guess what happend again? Do you want to know? Do you? Well too bad I see no point in telling you. It doesn't really matter. Whatever.&nbsp;Arn't emotions amusing. The answer is no. No, they're not.     Yeah today at school was really boring. It just made me realize more how much my grades have slipped. "sighs"     &nbsp; 
0	After finishing Sukisyo and Mirage no Blaze, both which left me somewhat disappointed, I'm left to draw the following conclusion:  In shonen ai series, you're lucky if they move beyond mandatory angst and ever get as far as a touch, much less an actual kiss. In yaoi, you're lucky if there's a plot attached to all the porn.  Then again... It's porn. Who needs plot?    *ahem*   Okay, best go attempt to write something now.
1	i got a early Christmas gift...a HELLO KITTY DIGITAL CAMERA!!! i wanted a digital camera but i didnt think i would get one especially a hello kitty. its soooo cute now i can post pictures.
0	I Love You.....  I miss you....  ....wish you knew.
1	and how random it is and how changing it makes me and those mermaids purple, I think with blue sparkles and magnet ears stuck on refrigerators on the way bottom of the Indian Sea and ooh la la
1	Ah, what an awesome night!  One of the best in I have had at Sarah Lawrence.  The British kids are absolutely amazing, and now I couldn't be more psyched for London.  Such great talks with Micheal & Andrew tonight, and everyone else I hung out with.  This certainly makes this one of the best weekends I've had here too; I can't believe I have had three incredibly fun, memorable nights in a row.  And I can't wait for brunch with the British kids tomorrow!!!  and...  HAPPY 21st BIRTHDAY, RAYNA!   ...shit I still haven't unpacked from break.
1	 I want to cosplay as Alex Row so badly right now it's not even funny...
1	heyy   Well i finished my room yesterday and i got to sleep in it last night....It was hott....:( nicole stole the air conditioner....Mean sister..... Yesterday i went to looney tunes and bought the new Taking Back Sunday cd...Its a good cd...you all should buy it...  Well today i woke up at 9:30 to get ready for work and then i found a ring in the video studio so its mine now...haha...its a pretty mood ring..my mom picked me up at 5:00...  I got home and my dad went to pick up my brother.....  Then I went to CVS and bought hair dye...I dyed my hair BROWN...yAy!!and tomorrow i am adding copper highlights...my mom and i were fighting in cvs 4 a hour because i wanted it carrot orange and she wanted it blonde...i wanted to get rid of the blonde helloo....so we settled on a copper color....as long as its not blonde...
1	WOOOOOOO band practise rocked.... for some more than others ;) SO happy! Finally!!!!! got nothing done... nevermind, the chips were good tho! Didn't go to the gig last night, it started at 9 i was like WHAT??! no. taking it easy today... after all the hardcore practising y-day lol erm WOOO bye people PS. bare jokes = naked jokes = dirty jokes ;) hehehe xxxxx
1	FINAL FOUR, BITCHES!!!!  And here's a big fuck you to all of those losers who said we couldn't do it! MUWAHAHAHHAHAHA  So I sat around the house most of my Easter weekend, eating and watching basketball...heck yes.  There were some TOTALLY amazing games...I got to bond with my dad cuz my brother is a n00b and doesn't like sports.  My dad said for the MSU vs. UNC game he's coming up here and wearing his Tar Heels gear...oh shit.  After we won last night, I was hoping to see some rioting going on...but there wasn't any...booooooo  Well I hung out with the fam and stuff...it was kinda ghey...I had to babysit 3 very small children but it was fun I suppose.  Alright I gotta get ready for class...MUAHZ!  GO STATE!!! :)
1	  All I have to say... is that the new Nike Pro Apparel commercial scares the shit outta me. If Mariano Rivera came into Yankee Stadium in the botton of the 8th wearing that metal scorpion thing, you'd watch everybody shit their pants.  But honestly, that commercial gives me nightmares. WTF?  
1	I just sang for NATS, a state-wide singing competition that was held at NCSA this year. I only competed in the musical theatre category this year and I think I did ok. I won't find out if I placed or not until 1:30. It was nice having it here because I just had to wake up get dressed and go sing, after warming up of course. Perry surprised me and came to Winston last night, it was sweet. We ordered a pizza and just hung around, watched my Kiss Me, Kate DVD. He left around 11 so I could get some sleep. I went to bed before 12 for the first time in... Lord knows how long. I was still tired when I woke up at 8. I'm contemplating going back to sleep now so I won't have to sit around and wait for the results. In fact, getting back in bed sounds really good, so I'm gonna do that. Happy Saturday, everyone!
1	and ive lost 5.25 inches!! No weight loss.. actually gained a .5 lb  - but we all know muscle weighs more than fat - so I *know* ive gained some muscle! I can see it - and I also see parts of my body starting to change. So i am excited!  This week Ive gone to curves 4 days, and have done a half hour walk after each session. Im also tracking what I eat with fitday.com .. I know Im going in the right direction.  Things I need to fix: - check the scale every morning - Drink more WATER - Get more protein in my diet   My only concerns are that my left knee is a little sore today. It doesnt hurt when i do any of the lower body workouts at curves - so im thinking its probably just not used to all the walking/activity.   Just wanted to let everyone know my progress. I hope you all are doing good too!  ~Mel
0	I feel like such a dumb ass. I really feel like a lame ass. my week is getting worst by the day. tonight i lost my nieces cell phone :0( When stoopid things like that happens to me I loose my humor, my energy & whatnot.  do i feel bad enough to cry? yeahhhhhhhhhhh   n e ways
1	Yay for software you really like having a "check update" feature!  It's too bad it's taken me 3 years to find it... DOHT!  I got a new camera lens for Xmas/Valentines/President's Day!!!  I'm all excited about it.  It's a  Canon, Ultra-Wide Zoom Lens  w/ hood!!  ( EF 20-35mm f/3.5-4.5 USM for the geeks out there)  I'm hoping this will stop me from having to hold my camera 3 feet above my head when taking my food shots and then I'll also be able to get whole buildings without backing up 400 feet! :)    I'm excited, even though I haven't really tried it out yet.  My memory card is full.  Why yes, I do have two.  I only have one full.  Just been too lazy to dig the other one out.  Besides, the current is an ULTRA CF card.  It's so fast!  I just have a hard time using the old card now.  Damn I'm spoiled.
1	Just updating to tell you that I switched to xanga( http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?us er=shannyfanny ) a while ago. I'm sorry, LJ. You've been really good to me. =D. I just needed a change.   &lt;3 Shann
1	Ok so I have finally found a reason why I should own a credit card. Or why after christmas I will find someone who has a credit card, give them $20 and make them buy me this shirt.. or one of these shirts because I want both.. and I want them  NOW!  I'm so excited about these.. I'm supressing squeals of joy as I type. I will own one and I will wear it constantly and you will all grow to despise the shirt!!!  Oh the joy!! *giggles*    Go Look and see the glory!!      http://montypythondirect.com/product_inf ormation.asp?PRODUCT=OG008927MOTS&TYPE=SwagGo and see more of the glory!    Hope these links work... Oh the glory of it all.   Also there is more glorious stuff here.. go look!
0	"this is a good way to channel my raging emotions of anger and depression because you all know that happens frequently with me"  that was a line from my first entry in this journal.  well yeah I hate myself again.  Why is happiness so short lived?  I'm lookin for a reason to wake up in the morning.  someone to look forward to.  someone to fill this empty chamber in my heart...
0	PRIVATE ENTRY  Well, fuck.  So Yumi has a crush on someone.  I always *thought* this day would come, but I never, you know, planned for it. After the whole thing with Theo passed, I guess I just sort of assumed that I'd admit to her the way I feel eventually, and then things would go on from there.  One thing I NEED to learn in life is that things never work out the way I figure they will. e_e  I guess I need to go to school now. Maybe I'll make this a longer entry when class is over.
1	this is Annaliese signing off for the week!  I'm off to NY, I packed less then I said so I hope it's still enough.  My luggage is JAM PACKED though. OY!  If you're going to see Firstman tonight, I'll see you there!
1	So I've decided to start writing in here again, now that my life's slowly getting itself together. I'm so excited about a bunch of things, but I'm not really at liberty to discuss them as of yet. My new job at Tower Records is, like, the coolest job ever. I work with cool people, have a cool boss, get a great discount, and get great hours. I loooove it. Alan's coming home next Saturday, which I'm soooo excited about. I haven't seen my best friend in a year! I'm looking to move down to south Jersey sometime soon, but I need me a roomie. I saw Bad Santa last night. Pretty cute flick....definitely a modern day Christmas Carol if you will. Well, I have soooo much more to talk about, but the juicy stuff comes later. Hopefully people will read this, cuz I think everyone gave up on my journal. Oh well, if you read this, leave some love.
0	Vacation was spent cleaning the house.   Cody arrived on Saturday, and I have missed him so much. I am so happy he is here.  Mom and lauren like him. They took him to a flea market in Lancaster yesterday. Mom bought him some books and a chai. lol  School is going well per usual. And I had hoped things would be back to normal...

0	So you know that job I hate?  Well, it won't be a problem anymore.  That's cause I got laid off on Friday and have one month to find my ass a new job.  But since I'm "a really great person", I'm sure things will turn out ok.  Or not.

1	 Drive Time Live (KEZM 1310 AM, Sulphur, LA)   hosted by Jay Morrison   special co-host for April 13, 2005 : Chris Elam   Yes folks, I co-hosted a talk radio program with       gonzo_rev    today.  I had a blast and he said it went really well.  I'm sure I could have done better in spots, but I think I did OK for a complete rookie.  I'm very happy with my performance.  Best of all, the entire program WAS recorded!  I can send out copies to interested parties when I get my hands on it myself.  More to come?  Stay tuned!  ~Cap

NOFX concert tomorow ahhhhh i can't sleep.
1	my dad's friend named his daughter  thank gof .hella weird. i thought the names i wanted were weird. i love my boyfriend. screw every boy that doesn't like me.[not in a sexual way, but geez stop talking shit] hooray for jamba juice runs. lunch with my boyfriend. couches are fun. so is the dark. childish kisses. :muah: show tomorrow at some place in whittier so i'll see you kids there. saturday's show is going to be hella awesome.   only the bands on this flyer are playing.  the kid throwing this show gave me the line up. sorry for the rest of the bands thinking you guys are playing it was a mistake. if you have questions comment back to this.
1	     Indians of North America  A-        Arts of Asia  A+        Environmental Politics  A+        Intro to Psych as a Natural Science  A       I learned how to play a Chicago song today.  (Hard to Say I'm Sorry).  score.
1	Today was a good day.  Nothing really spectacular happened...but nothing bad happened either.  I got up this morning, called Brett up, and he was busy today so I called Michael so me and him could atleast practice.  We did so for a bit, then we went back to my pad and I had to pick up my little sister then we went to the mall.  At first i thought the trip would be really boring, and at first it kinda was, but we ran into Dan and Joy, and talked with them for awhile.  Then we ran into Myke and Christina and Lisa and this other guy I keep forgeting his name!  That was great!  Christina had gotten the news about me and Sarah and we talked about that a bit.  Then we left and went to J-Box.  I dont understand how everyone doesnt just love that place.  Great food.  Their cheese sticks are good...i found that out today.  96.7 is a great radio station everyone.  I had to take the van today which only has a radio that works.  Its a great station if you ever have to listen to it.
1	I had sent him two txts. I didn't expect a response because he is in New York until Sunday., but I sent them anyway.  shortly after, as I was feeling the effects of the wine Marie bought for the dinner I made...my phone rang.   It said "JD" and I couldnt stop smiling. He didnt really have a reason to call me. He was a little drunk however, which can be taken two ways:  1. he would only call me when he is drunk 2. of all people to call, he called me  He was in the subway, and we eventually got cut off. He was telling me that he gets back on sunday and then has  to go directly to his parents for Easter dinner.  It made my entire night. I really want to see him.
0	I wish things were happier.  I wish Tammy would stay.  I miss Tammy already.  Please get better.  Yaaaay the tennis team got me a build-a-bear bunny dressed up in a tennis uniform.  Aww!!! So cute!  Thanks, girls!!!  Oh, my deer, I miss someone, who I haven't really talked to in a long time.  And it's because of something that I said.  And I wish that someone would talk to me about it...because I need to know what is wrong.  I probably made the mistake of saying something, because it was just something that randomly came into my mind.  I miss this someone too much, it might be bad.
0	*paces around and gibbers to herself*  Whaddawedo? Whaddawedo? Gothmog doesn't know anything about children, how is she going to get a balanced education with THEM!? I'm no good at this sort of thing, I'm not a fighty-counter-kidnappy type, I'm a healing type, and it's not like she was really unhappy here...;_;
1	 Been meaning to do this for a while now because I absolutely adore this man. This post is  not  dial-up friendly!   My reason for buying the 'Star Wars AotC' DVD      TEMUERA MORRISON              And that's a quite unrecognisable Marton under all those layers of costume.  Yeah, sheesh!!!!    Jake the Muss (with the fantastical Rena Owen)               From the DVD extras, interview.  Seems he'd already dropped some of the pounds he'd put on to play the Muss.   Publicity photo of 'Axel Hood' from 'Barb Wire'   more Axel                   From his small part in 'Vertical Limit'      Mention this actor's name in the US and most people go "Huh????"  But I was taken with him the first time I saw him, in what to this day is probably his greatest role (OK, no 'probably' about it) ... Jake the Muss in 'Once Were Warriors'.     
1	Success!  I now have an MP3 copy of the "Team March," the end credits theme to Buckaroo Banzai.  Sooooo 80s.  In a good way, though.  Oh, and in case I don't bother with entries tomorrow: have a merry Decemberween yo.
0	i am in such a fucking bad mood i fucking hate thanksgiving and i don't understand why this is happening again.  i was so fucking afraid that the same thing was going to happen again.  the same thing that happened last year--i had a terrible time going home.  so i avoided it, and came to orange county instead with my mom and her boyfriend.  i'm glad to be here but i don't understand what the fuck is wrong with me.  i feel like shit and i had a shitty weekend and i pray to god that the rest of this fucking week isn't like this.  jeff is talking so fucking loud.  there is nothing to do nowhere to hide and i can go to sleep and that's pretty much it.  i can't even find any shows to go to, not even in LA.  fuck this fuck thanksgiving i should have just stayed in san jose.
1	  Lots of people like this one!  It was a challenge to make, but I really like the end product.  The unicorn is made out of silky soft alpaca.
1	wowie im really hipper cause all these cool things happened today was fun so was yesterday i got my gutiar. Today was fun cecilia told me who she likes and andrew gonna hook them up cause he knows the guy and the guy likes her back. Then in 9th period i got called to go home then i met cecilia in the hall way my mom had called us both out to go then we went to millam cause my little bro did something bad at school (bad). Then i went to go get my hair cut which i love and know im doing my homework well g2g jam-out laterz
1	it feels so weird to be this happy at work... even though i have another  5 hrs  to go even though i have exams, and won't be able to go out for another  week and a half  even though i will only be able to go to  one  prom queen show even though i have  $300+  of fines to pay, and only $40 in my bank account :P happy happy   happy.   tom/kate/megan's party was fun, even though i came when most people left, and there were a few too many naked bodies for my liking.  haha.  so i probably won't see anyone this week/weekend but i still love you, and will be even  happier  soon because of the holidays.  xo
1	...arrived TODAY!!!  I can't wait to watch it.  I'm especially happy because it has a bonus track.  This track is a magical performance by Four Voices with the Voices of Lee.  I'm heading to the TV now!  :)
1	Wow O.o it's about a month since I updated this. Meh, I hardly had any time to do that though.  Last thing I wrote here was that Toby left, and well after that I went home to my parents nd my sis. I stayed there for about a week, and then went back to Mainz with my friend Sabine. We had a great time there, and she really liked the city. We had trouble with finding a decent disco though, it's quite hard. Lol.  After that, I went back to my parents again, and then back to Mainz with Tina. It was great too. We had so much fun. We bought some of those scent things, which smell when you light them. So many different smells... I almost wanted to eat the cassis one since it smelled sooooo pwetty ^_^  Well now I am here at TOby's house again, and having fun. He gave me a webcam :D but he's slightly obsessed with it, he's taking pictures of me and everything with it all along O.o scary O.o
0	I have never been so tired in my entire life.  I am listening to the new Weezer single. Its literally twice as bad as Hash Pipe, which was such a let down.   Wow..      
1	     Wow...just...wow.&nbsp; Thanks Anna, I can sleep better at night knowing the Gimps are getting their kink on!  Good for the gimps!
1	I gots 4 people who want to come and see Howl's Moving Castle when it premieres in San Francisco on June 10th.  It may or not be at Metreon, but since they are wide-releasing it, we can pretty much bank on Metreon or another major SF theater.        soletta   ,       k_valentine   , and       mognetcentral    want to see it in SAN FRANCISCO.        riobranden    is being ornery and wants to see it in Dublin at the Regal if it opens there.  I would be good with either, but have no preference.  We still have a couple months to plan this, so no rush.  :P
0	Today was my second day of work. I received my schedule and it wasn't quite what I was hoping for. I'm going to be in their new office, which doesn't open until next Monday. Then I'm only scheduled for 15 hours next week and only 29.5 hours the following week. I just hope that everything works out for me.
0	here i go. scream my lungs out and try to get to you.          here's to my dreams :: chugs the drink and throws the glass on the floor::
1	ok.  grammy is going to the dr today.  no other news yet.  my mom and i r going to Oregon on the 27th.  i asked my mom what happens if i wanna stay there.  she said i would have to come home and pack my stuff then i can go back out there.  i would be living with my aunt.  she is so excited about us coming out there.  she told my mom that she could forget me out there.  my aunt wants me to move in with her.  she lives right down the street from the college.  she actually lives in college town, she said her neighbor is really hot.  cant wait to meet him.  tiff is here and wants to go online.  update later.

1	Yes, tonight it opening night of the Matrix Revolutions. No news there. But attending the Loews theater at 13th street and Broadway, it was astonishing how unprepared they were for people arriving two hours early. Taking things into our own hands, Noemi and I began the line for the 7:20.   Eventually, the line went down the block, but at first there were four guys huddling in the spot where we needed the line to begin.  "Excuse me, are you here for the 7:20 matrix?" I asked.  Oh no, no, they said, and began to leave. At that point, the man in the middle, his head turned down and shrowded in a gray sweatshirt lifted his face. It was Frodo! Elijah Wood!  Our Matrix line was blessed by Frodo. How cool is that?
0	I'm not having a good time in life.  Things are just really getting to me lately.  Especially wanting things that aren't possible.  I'm sick and tired of crying every day.  I'm sick of having no energy because I'm sad every day.  And I'm sick of not being able to just be with Roger every day.  It makes me physically ill.   
0	You got to get up right now Turn the system upside down Your 'sposed to be fed up right now Turn the system upside down Get up!
0	So I went for a walk. And I was anything but alone...   It could have been worse: I could have been stuck in my car in mad traffic.                 What a great day for the Scooby Doo Two premiere.  Not. :/ On a very cool note, I ran into my long lost KHET friend, Lohi, at the store this morning. :)
0	There has only been two days of school and already i hate it. Yesterday my day was just stupid like always but then someone had to ruin it even more!!! While walking down the hall this guy was coming toward me with this girl when he was close to me he pushed her so that she could push me. I cussed him out while he was walking down the hall. I wouldnt of done that if it wasnt so obvious that it was on purpose. He pissed me off. Today well, I took two tests one that i gussed on about 20 of the problems and the other that was just plain stupid! In that class i have to sit in front of everyone because there isint enough seats! This totally sucks. Im feeling so depressed right now. I didnt know what to do so i popped in Jets to Brazil and cried myself to sleep. PATHETIC!
1	I hope you have a great one :)  Well, at least that it gets better ;)  My poor sister had such a rough day for it to be her birthday, which was topped off by a hit and run when she came out of class!  I really hate people who do that!  I hope I was able to cheer her up a bit...I  got the biggest triple fudge brownie I could find and put a winking smiley face candle on top!  Then I took it to her at work to cheer her up... I think she liked it ;)  Well, hopefully we'll have more fun moving her into her new apartment in a few weeks!  Yay!!  Tonight we're gonna meet up for drinks after she gets done working.... a nice end to a screwy day ;)
1	Sorry for the lack of updates! ^^;;;;;;;;  Nothing much has been happening but...Well, I'm sure this next episode of Matt the Magnificent will explain my situation!  Matt, after struggling through with the hardships of being a freshman at highschool, has finally made it near the halfway mark!  But a greater enemy than that of High school still looms ahead....EXAMS!  These exams are no simple tests, These are about 20 percent of Matt's grade, for ALL of his classes!  Matt, knowing his responsiblities and the consuequnces if he does poor on these exams, studies hard for the long and arduous exams ahead!  But will it be enough? Will Matt be able to successfully pass these exams, and hopefully move on to the next semester?!  Next time on Matt the Magnificent, episode 22;  'What's This?!  Sudden Exam Attack, Look Out Matt!' "I can't fail after coming so far!"  [cue Japanese theme of Budokai 2]
1	 This weekend  Wnet over to Scott's and had really good times! Saturday we went to the Ren Fair with both of our Moms. They seemed to get along really well. My mom really likes       vialle   . Like enough to ditch us next time and just hang out with her. I'm a little jealous. Like this much &gt;--&lt;. :-p  Sunday we headed over to Ross + Adrienne's and had a great time there. That was super cool!   In between all that was some food and lots of sleep. *drools thinking about sleeps*   Today  NATALIA'S BACK AT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!! LIFE IS GOOD!!!!!! She's looking extra super great!! Other tahn that, not too much else going on. Need to get things situated at home.
0	Today is a sad day. My cat is missing. My cat is one of the loves of my life and my whole family is is shambles over my kitty missing. We found his collar in our yard. I hope he is okay. If you are religious please say a prayer for my cat. If you are not religious, please just keep him in your thoughts. Thanks.

1	This week's       photochallenge    theme is "Trapped."  This isn't perfectly executed, but the pets weren't as cooperative as I'd hoped.  That said, I'm pretty happy with it.      Trapped Click for larger.    Sould I go back to the drawing board, or submit this one (I've got until Thursday p.m. as usual)?  Update:  I had the idea last night/this morning to crop this closer.        Trapped Click for larger.    Or:      Trapped Click for larger.    I think I like this one better.  You?
0	Paul Hester hung himself on the weekend. He dated my aunty years and years ago before she ended up with my uncle. I'm sure I've met him somewhere along the years, but I just can't remember. I did go to the Finn concert and Paul joined in on a couple of songs and he was laughing and joking along with them.   I hope my uncle and aunty are ok.

1	well i procrastinated packing until the morning of departure. i just really dont like packing. but what i hate more is unpacking. i just like staying put. but at least this time tomorrow i'll be in warm charleston. looks like 70s all week! thats the thing im looking forward to most.  these first two days of break have been good. hopefully it keeps up. i'll be back late thursday night or friday, until then dont play too much tennis without me!!   oh and if anyone desparatly needs me , i'll have my cell and i dont have roaming, so call all you want!
1	Well, I'm half way through grad. week.  Thank goodness.  I had no idea how hard it was to get 150 people to get in a straight line.  It's nearly impossible.  And no, I'm not kidding.  I took my ap lit. exam today.  I think I did decently.  Hopefully, I did decently...  Well, that's all for today.  Tomorrow is my last day at school until graduation.  Awwww.... oh well.  Goodbye for tonight.  Meaghan The Graduate
1	I really have fallen in love with the 15 inch G4 iMac PowerBook. I'm hoping that I get a BIG tax return back so I can possibly strike a deal with my parents that I'll give them my tax return money if they pay off the rest of the cost for the powerbook. Or else, I'll have to work the streets. I think I could make $2000 in a few nights... heck maybe I could even go for the superdrive and work it an extra night.   Of course... I could also use my tax return to pay off bills... hmm dilemma.   Maybe I should actually do my taxes and see where I'm at then. Good Plan.
1	Brad Pitt my fave ACTOR + Angelina Jolie my fave ACTRESS + ASSASSINS + Director of Bourne Identity = I'm convinced this movie was made for  ME      Mr. and Mrs. Smith    I can't wait till it comes out *_*!!!  JUNE 10 
0	Oh well.  It was a fun thought to entertain while it lasted.  Of course, I'm getting up in 4 hours to have breakfast with her anyway.  Go figure.  One of these days, the right girl will come along.  I'll just hate every day until then.  When you're me, being single blows.  It's like the line from Fight Club about "you are not how much money is in your wallet.. you are not your job..." etc etc... I agree with all of that.  What I am, however, is my friendships and relationships.  And if I don't have a relationship, that means that a part of me... just isn't.  And that really sucks.  --Evan  PS thank God for my roommate
1	I'm posting this from  MY OWN PC !  I fumbled about trying to set it up to recognise the network earlier, but I failed quite miserably. John didn't have much trouble with it, though. Now I need to download loads of stuff..  First stop: Soulseek!
1	Patriots won. And according to kaizoku-fansubs, if they won they would released ep 130 today! ^^ happy days....
0	and so, once again, i walk alone.   i kinda saw it coming, but it's still a shock to hear.   it came down to religion.  it always comes down to religion.  i hate that word.
1	damn am i a dork.  the subject of my post is the name of an opi shade i paint my nails.  all seems ok.  been a rough week or so.  i'm pushing through though.  i worked an extra hour last week and that meant i got to come in an hour late today.  this gave me time to stop in at the BAC this morning and then run home to shower.  all before i met up with d12 for breakfast.  a bagel with the creamy cheesey, cheesey creamy, cheesey cheesey :)   i am actually feeling very well today.  i want, no i need it to stay that way.    i am down to less then one week.  i can't say i'm happy about it.  i try to ignore it, but the fear creeps in and i worry that even though i post about it... people will still forget.  worse yet, just not care.  blah, no more thinking about this.  i will not let this line of thought ruin my good day!
1	 oh my I totally love this song    I've waited hours for this  I've made myself so sick  I wish I'd stayed asleep today  I never thought this day would end  I never thought tonight could ever be  This close to me    Just try to see in the dark  Just try to make it work  To feel the fear before you're here  I make the shapes come much too close  I pull my eyes out  Hold my breath  And wait until I shake...    But if I had your faith  Then I could make it safe and clean  If only I was sure  That my head on the door was a dream    I've waited hours for this  I've made myself so sick  I wish I'd stayed asleep today  I never thought this day would end  I never thought tonight could ever be  This close to me    But if I had your face  I could make it safe and clean  If only I was sure  That my head on the door  Was a dream      Think it's mainly because of the tinkly music it comes with.
1	If I do say so myself, I make absolutely orgasmic Cosmos.  They are truly, truly delish.  Yumyumyumyum.    Just practiced lacrosse with my homie g dawg fo shizzle dizzle (aka, my broski).  He's awesome.  I'm getting so good, too!  I'm like, HELLA excited for lacrosse season.  It's gonna rock HARD.  (I hope)  Plus, we have like, the coolest team ever.    And in a few hours I'm going to see Meet the Fockers with my hoomie g dawg fo shizzle dizzle.  Man, this has been a sibling-bonding day... which is intensely cool.  Unfortunately, not a lot of progress on science proj.    Um, screw THAT.
1	Of course, when I am at the beginning of my journey of Thesis writing and MCAT destroying I am confronted with a scratchy throat and an aching head.  You'd think these were minor foes but do not discount their persistence.  Many a warrior enjoyed the sublime experience of hubris thinking that they could simply be ignored...thus...mmmm....drugs are my friend.  So with that I'm up, I'm up!  I'm stretching, typing, heating up my bathroom so I can have naked time in the warmth, (my apartment has very odd heating involving gas fueled wall units, heh, god bless New Orleans) and feeling pretty damned good, anyways.  Didn't sleep much, but that's ok, dreaming doesn't always require sleep ya know...  -Michael Aaron Dietz  PS:  It's 12:34, have you kissed your clock lately?
1	Today is a happy day.  I finally got my journal looking something like how I'd like it. anyone have any good quotes? I was playing with the freetext thingie, and now I feel the need for good quotes.  and I got my application together, absolutely done. I just have to turn it in.  oh, man. I want to see sin city so bad.
1	Having one of your non-sensitive male friends agree to go feed ducks with you and watch the fountain go off, just b/c it brings you joy.  My friends once again prove they're better than yours.  I love feeding the ducks.  It's the best.
1	So I get to meet Rob today!  He's going to call me when he gets out of work and we're probably going to meet at Starbucks.  I'm so excited!    Before I go anywhere though, I need to finish cleaning my room, which I didn't do last night.  I spent like 2 hours at Walmart and I GOT NEW SANDALS YAY!  And I need to exercise.  And shower.  I'm currently DLing "Look what you've done" by Jet--which surprised the shit out of me that they did that song, since they also did "Cold Hard Bitch"  And I'm also DLing System of a Down's "BYOB".  ^_^

1	I just wanted to announce that my beautiful girlfriend just got accepted to the University of Florida.  She'll be starting in the fall in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS). I just wanted everyone to know.
1	shirts really are pointless  (as well as socks.)   and i think i like butterflies. and hello kitty is just mad hot. or something. :) &hearts
1	Armed with new hair which can only be described by Arthur Dent as he looked out his window before judgement day at the caterpillar on his lawn:   "yellow"  ... and a new compilation of me short stories, I think I might be ready for APE! Look out California, here I come again! Oh, and Matt's coming too. :D   Purple Passion's  all done ... anyone who'll be at APE this year, come check out my new compilation book of all my short stories! It's in black & white ... but shh, still cool!  It has come to my attention via Sean that Purple Passion could just be an advertisement for Purple Passion Lipstick. Taglines thus far are: (also thanks to Sean) "Purple Passion - it keeps you going" "Purple Passion - kick ass and chew bubblegum" "Stays on even while killing & vomiting!" "Purple Passion - after a hard day's work, dress to impress"
1	THe two songs i am REALLY  feeling and are speaking my life in many ways..  are  1. Kelly Clarksons = Break Away. I love that song so much. AND i dont know,  Kelly Clarkson always reminds me of Hailey, the Hailey taht i loved so much the part of her that was fun and free and happy :)   So i never ever feel sad when i hear her :)  But the song is sooooooooooooooooo good and speaking to me right now in the direction  I am going with my writting class and  my relationship with friends, and my life :)  nuff said   2. What you waiting for - Gwynn Stefani   OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH LORD is this a great song or what. Just listen to the words I love it. With my stability issues this song is like  JUST DO IT LOL :)      side note song : Daughters - John Mayer  Man this song is for every girl with dad issues. Ilove it so much and its so true. :)
0	yea i deleted that last entry....you guys really don't need to know anything like that and it sorrry i even put it out there ..i was just sad and thought that would be the best thing to do
1	Happiest of Birthdays to someone who is always so good to me, brings a smile to my face on a regular basis, makes my kids SHOUT WITH GLEE, and is always a nice addition to a family gathering.        kingchiron   , may your day be filled with joy, and your year be filled with wonder and happiness.
1	Yes!   Yes, yes, yes!!   Go here:    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7051296/       This is awesome, hopefully it means that the death penalty will be abolished entirely instead of just for minors.   I'm not excusing criminals for the crimes, I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy of killing murderers.

0	Ohhh...allergies. They suck. I CANT STAND IT ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyway. My life is so dull. It's homework and neopets and more homework, and just for the heck of it, school. Did I mention I go to LaSalle Academy? It's okay, but if you're one of those people who never does homework (and who does?), you'll hate it. I think the teachers have contests to see who can assign the most homework before the students collapse from exhaustion. So far, Mrs. Williams, the biology teacher, is probably winning. Spring vacation...if only it came a week sooner! I can't believe it. I'm going to Vermont, where there's ...guess what!...more snow. I WANT SUMMER!   Sorry. All this homework is making me kind of lose it.
1	and stuff... well, another year down... they go by so fast lately...

1	A very simple yet addicting game!  http://www.eyezmaze.com/grow/grow.s wf  good for when you're stuck at work. :)  On a side note, my car is fixed now yay! it has a new water pump and a new timing belt. It seems that when the water pump went it damaged my timing belt to the point where it was about to snap(I'm sure my engine would not have liked that at all!).   I also fixed my driver side speaker. One of the cables for it got loose. I had to take the door panel off to get to it but it was much easier than I thought it would be since my dad helped me with it.  I have to wash my car but my brother has the car cleaning stuff. :(
0	For the second time now, I didn't get into the Visual Language major. At least I don't think I did. I have yet to recieve an email for any kind of interview. Others have stating that their Audits have been looked at. I have yet to receive that. Meaning my GPA has hurt me. Now....I don't know what to do. I guess internet interactive, but all I see is a future in blockbuster. I I don't know what to do. I am fucking scared at the fact that I have been nothing but a waste here. A waste of time, money, and the faith of my parents. I....just don't know anymore..
1	Only because the baton was passed to me...  1.)Total volume of music files on my computar? 1,300...screw having dial up for so long  2.) The last CD I bought was? The Mars Volta-Frances The Mute  3.)The last song I listened to before writting this was: Sin With Sebastian "Shut Up (hahha, no joke Chris)  4.) Five songs I listen to a lot, or that mean a lot to me: -"Let's All Make Believe"--Oasis -"Stakeout"--Freezepop -"Shattered"--The Cranberries -"Posed to Death"--The Faint -"Fuckin On the Dance Floor"--Dirty Sanchez 5.) Five people you will pass Baton to: -meekpest -leeleeann -fantisera -moosche622 -punkfuchicken
0	Ever feel like a friend you really cared about is just drifting further and further from you and no matter how hard you try to bring them back they just reassure you that you're as close as ever then continue to drift away... Well I'm feeling that, I finally start to get closer to him and now it seems that everytime I talk to him his interest is somewhere else with someone else... it's very upsetting... yeah I'm probley just whining out my paranoid delusions like I often do but man this is just really upsetting me... I'm trying so hard to keep my self as a close friend cause I dont just want to be thought of as a certain thing to someone.. I want to be more I want them to like me so much that they think about me more than just when I'm chatting with them... I'm pretty darn certain that everyone has delt with this atleast once, so you all should understand that this feeling really hurts... I dont want to lose my friends... ;_;  ~Wolve

0	Second week of class.  It's official, really and truly.  I'm back to the grind.  Class.  It's not so bad, but I miss John, and I hate school.  I can't understand those people who know that they want doctorates and stuff.  I know I'm barely going to make it through undergrad, much less six more freaking years.  And so, I am condemned to the world of the half-talented.  Secretarial work to look forward to.  Oh joy.

For dinner I ate some sesame seed pita chips w/ hummous.  Then I had some Tostitos with spinach dip.  I also had some bread with hummous, and some chocolate chip cookies. I drank a glass of water.  I wore blue jeans, Sauconys, my blue jacket w/ Dwarves pin, a grey tshirt that says 'Streetfighter', boxer shorts, and socks.

1	i don't know why i fell asleep somewhere around 11:30 last night.  [well, i did have a tummy ache a bit.]  nor why i just  woke up  at 7:30 for no reason and made me bed all neat and stuff.  i don't have anywhere i hafta go.  not till 5pm.  what i do know is when my icon happened on veronica mars [logan grabbing her and kissing all like WHOA and hot and stuff] i screamed out loud.  so there.  logan is of the hotness.  lately i just have icons i like.  not ones that necessarily make sense for the particular situation.  =)  today is brody's 32nd birthday.  is a picspam in order?  i think so.  not that i'm all that excited or nothing, just bored.  heh.  cheerios time!  honey-friggin-nut-cheerios dood!

1	Happy Turkey Day everyone!  I hope everyone has a great holiday and extended weekend.  It's been so crazy here since I got back from vacation that I've barely had time to keep up with my friend's journals!  Maybe someday I'll get to post about the Arizona vacation.  I just got pictures back.  I got some great pics of the Grand Canyon.  Exciting news... a new car is on the horizon for me!  The 95 Honda Civic will soon be going to a new home.  I feel a little sad about this.  We've been together for so long and I have become so attached.  I hope I can find a good home for him.  One where they will wash him and keep his maintenance up.  I test drove new Hondas on Friday and the difference was amazing!  It looks like I'll be getting a Honda Accord Sedan EX.  It's time for me to graduate to the world of four doors.  Well, back to the grind.  I hope I can get out of here by 3pm.

1	Oliver, you rock! What a great game!   It was good to see everybody, a little weird because there was nobody my age there, but it was great to see Ginny and Susan and Luna, and Wood, of course. Vati seemed a bit distracted, but I guess that's nothing to be surprised at. Who was that kid annoying her? He's cute, but wow. What a mouth on him!   We get to meet Bulgarians tomorrow! Yay for cute Quidditch boys.  Hey, Oliver, can you introduce me to your team's Beater? I officially have a  huge  crush on him!
0	The Cornelia I need to complete my set is up on eBay. I put in a fairly high bid and have already been outbid. The girls may have to remain W.I.T.H. But I do take some solace in the fact that she's not the prettiest doll. She looks rather washed out. One of my few complaints about this line is their lipstick. Taranee has lovely dark lipstick and Hay's is peachy orange, but Will, Irma and it looks like Cornelia, too, all have lipstick that's too pale for them. Irma pulls the look off somehow, but Will looks a bit odd. I think Corny looks the worst, because of her pale hair. I would have been happier to see a pink lip color for her.   I'm still waiting on the ToyManila keychain series photos. Irma is on eBay from the same seller as the 12" guardian Corny and I don't care for her. I still want to see pics of the others though.
1	I have a friendly lizzard living just outside my house.  He's about a foot long and quite fat.  The other day I left the door open and was just sitting on the lounge and he just walked into the house.  It was stinking hot outside and I think he was just looking for a cooler place to cool down.

1	No, it's not what you think, but I am IN LOVE with the boys basketball team.  Can i just say they are the greatest 12 guys i have EVER met?  Words cannot say how much i will miss them when this week is over (well, the banquet's on wed... so maybe the next week).  They are the best guys, and I am in love!  We beat Monarch BABY!! YEAH!!  The last time Creek made it to the Final Four was in 1995, when they won STATE!!  Now, we face Wheat Ridge.  I have a good feeling about this game.  I'm nervous, of course, but I have a good feeling.  I had this same feeling when we played East, and we won that one too... so hopefully, we'll win.    I just love basketball, and all the guys, and I truely believe Jenna and I are THE luckiest girls in all the World to be able to be part of this team!    That was kinda random... oh well
0	I was looking through magazines today and ran across the Josh Duhamel Gap ad in the September issue of Cargo (a guys tech mag) and the Lenny Kravitz one in the September issue of Vibe(a guys mag geared to African Americans).  Alas, no Michael so far.  A lot of magazines still didn't have the September issues out yet.  The good news is each person's ad seems to be two full pages in color near the front of the magazine.  So two full pages, means two different outfits.  Now all we need to know is which darn magazine to buy  ETA:  I think the other magazines the ads are supposed to be in are Details, Maxim and Sports Illustrated (which is probably going to be the New England Patriot guy).  That leave Peter Krause and Michael for Details or Maxim, or something else.  No, I'm not giving this a lot of thought or anything, why do you ask?

1	...In love!    Indeed what a day this has been. My boy did me proud at class elections. This group of total jerkwads behind me were bad-mouthing everyone so far. Until Zach steps up to the plate,and suddenly I thought I could've actually gotten along with 'em!  But no.  I despise jocks.  Moving on,I now have my Spellbound stuff outta the way,but that's just the words. Us vowels need to get together and work out our song. Vowels,ASSEMBLE!    The final touch? I got cast for MCM!! I'm sooo excited! I can get ragged on all day about who I'm playing (don't wanna spoil it for those who read this and aren't in it!) and still not care! I really hope I can nail it,but I think I can do it.  But as excited as I am,I have to say I'm a little intimidated too...in fact,a LOT intimidated...  But hey-  Since when has that ever stopped me?
0	     I'm trying to get all my Livejournal friends' locations plotted on  a map  - please add your location starting with this form.

0	So, last night did not go as well as planned. It was a good night, I spoiled it for myself being an idiot. A sober idiot, too, so I haven't even an excuse. (No, I do not want to talk about it, and yes, if you ask then you're likely to get your head bitten off.)       Joshy had an early Christmas present (picked by me and paid for by Nick.)                    ...but I think Keira and Nick might steal it from him.     A cute picture of Master Joshua:     Saying 'ta' to Nick.     And then we left him with       oldgrub    so we could go to the party. (Perhaps I should have babysat, though. Might have ended up feeling better that way. *le sigh* /melodrama.)     (Lookit, my new red coat!)  Keira looks purdy:     And I look relatively slim, hooray (although you can't really see me for the mess o.0)      [Some pics cross posted at       rentboibloom   ].

1	I'm a moron.  That step-up position I applied for here at Duquesne light is 5 thou a MONTH, not a YEAR.  Silly me.  Cue soundtrack from "A Chorus Line": "OOHHH GOD I NEEED THIS JOOOOB!"  In other news, there's another position available in payment processing on the North Side. Full time. Full benny's. $2,700 a month. MAKE MY OWN HOURS.  I'm so totally on that.
1	Early this morning,       keri80   's mom brought the  twins  home.  So, after a VERY late night playing HeroScape to an early morning with the twins... its like I aged 10 years while sleeping... from the light night bachelor days to daily parenthood. Yowch!  Some coffee later, keri80 and I were busy playing puzzles and such with the monkeys.  Puzzles, music, and more. Today is all about reconnecting with the monkeys ;)  It's so weird to me that I missed them when they were away.  I was never one for having kids, but I certainly do like having them now.  Not once before I was thirty did I ever, even remotely, consider the possibility of having kids.  Not once.  But, life is what you make it, and sometimes it turns out to be something totally different than what you imagined.  Sometimes, that can turn out for the better.  This is one of those times.

1	You remember that secret project I mentioned?&nbsp; The one I can't talk about until it's official announcement?&nbsp; Well, I just got the colored covers in email to look over and they look fucking great.&nbsp; I am dying to show these things off!&nbsp; There should be some sort of announcement inside the next week or two on one of the comic news sites, then I'll post them up and talk about the project at length.&nbsp; This is going to be a great year for me between Simon Spector, 303, this one shot and the mini series I have lined up after 303 (assuming everything goes as planned).&nbsp; Now I just have to make sure the deadlines don't kill me and I don't end up burning out but since I love the projects I'm working on, I can't see that happening.
1	*Magically charmed to be seen ONLY by the members of the Order of the Phoenix*  As you all know, today is Bill's birthday (32 - getting up in years, Billy!), so I'm having a bit of a celebration for him tonight.  You're all welcome to stop by!  I'll make dinner - I was thinking perhaps a...roast? Or is that dish reserved for Aurors? *wink*   Happy Birthday, Billy! 
0	I feel like an empty shell.... I was crushed today durning band...  We found out why our old director was fired.  Sexual abuse.  And it wasnt recent.  An old alumni called up worried about one of their childrens saftey if they were to go to the school since they had been abused when they went there and once others learned of that they steped foward.  I never though McClure would do something like that.... he was such a nice person....  My parents are going to a special meeting tonight, hopefully they will get more details....   P.S. We aren't going to State, apparently that made half the band happy for some reason.......  P.P.S. Incase any of you are looking back (which I doubt cause you have no reason too) I changed the above P.S. from "regionals" to "State"  That was a bad typo, changed the entire meaning.
1	Hey there,  Well...ok...ya, I haven't updated my journal in a while.  A friend pointed out to me that it was time for a new post....Andrew this is for you...lol.... So, it's Tueday and I've just had Christmas break...woohoo!  Quality time with my family...friends...retreat...YAY!  Complete awesomeness right there....(ya, I will interject right now that I spent some time with Matt Siler and now I'm using words like awesomeness)  So, I learned so much. The studies on being "Called and Accountable" were amazing.  And small groups provided the chance for intimate conversations.  Worship time was great and caused me to think about the God we were singing about...and yes, the worship band was good too...And come on, who could ever forget those endless games of UNO...the "crazy Canadian way"!!!!  Oh, and I saw "Napolean Dynamite"..."GOSH...."   Anyhow, all for now...back to replying to my emails.   LB

Halfway their... his back tire blows out..

0	oi. can this quarter be over yet? seriously. i am not doing good at all. acting has got me down, boys have got me down, friends have got me down, my outlook on my future has got me down, being away from home has got me down. i'm in a serious funk. i get major bouts of depression every few months as, I guess, a "side effect" of my surgery. its hard being away from home and dealing with it. even though i never really talked with anyone at home when I was in one, but still, i was at home. i will be seeing a counselor tomorrow, so i'll have someone to talk to who can give me an un-biased opinion about people giving me problems. i guess i've gotten to a point where i have to start taking care of myself and take control, 'cause if i'm gonna be in the entertainment industry, i gotta be able to look after myself.  so here's to a better me...one day at a time.  and lucky me, i'm not the patient type...  this is going to be a long road.
1	Hey, everyone! This isn't going to be a long entry...I'm about to leave the house and go purchase my vehicle (Yay! My long nightmare should now be over!) Knock on wood, that there are no problems. I have to drive about 45 minutes to a Honda dealership and I have no sense of direction ( I could get lost in my backyard). If you don't hear from me again, I'm still trying to find the Honda dealership in Wilson.   I have been working on Chapter 4 of Drop in the Ocean and hope to have it posted today. Heaven and I are updating Time of their Lives today as well and when I get back I get to respond to reviews as it is my turn.   Well, that's it for now. Wish me luck to make it to the dealership and to not get taken for every penny I have.   See ya!
1	Been working on two very exciting new commissioned projects: Neuschwanstein & Starry Eyed Surprise.  They should be completed by the end of the week.   I love the way Neuschwanstein's symbol turned out...it's very delicate & detailed!  It is based on the German castle with the same name. ^_^ She will have a glittery German flag on her magnet hoof.    Still working on the complex symbols...a glittery shooting star with a rainbow tail.  Also, her Kanekalon hair needs a lot of work! ^_~
1	There has been two new additions to the life of me. There names are Spike and Ari, and they currently reside in the new mini-fishtank (aka one step up from a bowl) next to my computer. Spike is white and orange with black spots (and a cool looking black and white fin) and Ari is bright orange with white on the bottom. I've had them for about 6 1/2 hours and they are still alive! YAY for me! Everyone guessed right away I named one Spike, because the obsession is naturally well-known throughout my circle of people. Ari, however, no one guessed except for the father of me, who is also an Ari fan, which is how very good proof that we are in fact related. And for those of you who don't know, Ari is the name of the agent on Entourage, played by 'The Piven', as I like to call him. Oh yes, and incase there's any doubt, let me clear it up: they are real fish too, not colored gold fish crackers that I stuck in a tank, I am not Crazy Eddie on 'Friends'............................... ....yet.

1	 hey. i'm actually getting excited about christmas this year. last year i wasn't. then it messed up the b-day excitement as well. i really want my own computer this christmas but i doubt my parents are going to get it for me.        on wednesday i went with Grace and April to the city to see a series of unfortunate events. it was a good representation of the books. we then walked to darling harbour, mostly bare foot. we then got some Tamaotchi. mine is named Pop, and April named hers God. apparently mine is the only girl Grace knows of. Go Pop!      Ahh tonight i get&nbsp; to eat all the chocolate left in the calender, ymmmm!

I think I'm most likely gonna get one of their handmade or aurumite designs, but I dont know. I might just stick to the signature model. Hmm...I'd love to have a 14k rose gold flute, but I can't afford anything like that right now. Maybe I can have a headjoint custom made with rose gold, dunno though, lol.    -The Warbler

1	You know something that is weird? There are always people on the freeway! At 11 last night on the 80 there were so many people, where is everyone going?!  Anyway, the big surprise is that I got a new car!!     That's mine! In my apartment parking lot! It's so cute, I really like that color. So yeah, my dad called me up yesterday and was just like "come to Walnut Creek". And I was like, uhhhhh ok! So, sadly the hooptie got sold. Rachel still has the blue bullet, and my dad is driving the CRV because Rachel rejected it. I gotta read the owner's manual now :).

0	WOW.  Did you do what I think you did?  Do I suck that much or something?  Maybe I should completely stop communicating with humans.  You know, since I can't say anything right anyway.   EDIT :  *sigh*  If I explained everything it would make more sense but I don't know if that would make me feel better.  Might make me feel worse, explaining everything and getting nothing out of that other than a "Okay now I know what happened," you know?  How futile.
1	Chilled with Ton and Jamie, that was really fun! Went to work that was actually fun and i made like $20 in tips!!! Then went to a party at Lizzy's house for a while!!! wow today Flippin rock.

0	 StickingOurNosesInEveryoneElsesBusiness.c om   Possibly the scariest site the Internet has to offer.  But  keep an eye on 'em , because they're definitely  keeping an eye on you  (and  boobs ).  Americans, please  remember to vote  this fall. These neanderthal fucktwirls certainly will.   Please ?  I don't mind if people want their freedom  of  religion, just as long as they tolerate the rights of the rest of us to choose freedom  from  religion if we so desire, yeah? If they want the government to keep its nose out of their religion, they'd better  keep their religion out  of our government.  They act so shocked when you call them  bigots , too! Just because, you know, they hate  the queers  (among others).  And probably  you .  These are the people who think that  Bill O'Reilly isn't right-wing enough .  Where does one go to seek a voice of reason in these confused times? Don't give up hope, citizens. The  Landover Baptists  will lead us into the light!

0	You've all played Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, right?  Remember "Sanctuary" and all those other cute little safe places you'd come across and score help - hearts, weapons, potions, information, advice, and even funny conversation sometimes -  Alan and I used to love finding 'em.  We'd be all excited, and so happy, I mean with that tinkly soothing music and feeling of being protected - how could you not just LOVE it after fighting a hard battle with some giant centipede...after taking many wounds...after such a long journey all alone?  God we loved that peaceful feeling, and man I love that game.  So, I found a Sanctuary over the weekend.  And now I'z sure (in the style of Conan O'Brien) "I'm-a-gonna-go-to-Hell-when-I-die..."  ...  ...  Alright!!  So who wants to PARTY?!  Dibs on Jessica's clover-design Ecstasy!!

0	Well today was.. blah. Why can't there be more good days then bad ones? I've been working on this project for a really long time, doing massive amounts of work and even more than I was supposed to, to make it much better.. and it just feels like alot of the time I get no support.. no one even listens to me. It's like I'm taken for granted.. no one would care even if I left, untill they noticed the work had stopped. Izzy does care about me though. *huggles Izzy* Kuri does to. *huggles kuri-chan*   I don't know about other people though, somtimes it's like they just forget about me.. maybe I'm easy to forget.  And I espically hate it when you offer an idea, then it gets turned all around and no one cares about what you wanted and.. blah.. why do I try?  *sighs*  I think I really need that cup of tea and bath I always say I should take, but never do. So sad..

I love the guys I live with and I adore all my male friends, but I am in need of my female friends.lol. Which a lost few have been popping back up into my life lately. Both Beckys, Shayna, Ange and Amy too. Hopefully Autumns also. Yay!   So the infection in my ear hasn't been feeling much better. I broke down crying last night at work because it hurt so bad. That along with my tooth, which I still need to get that shit pulled out...grrrr. Soon enough though.  Well that is about all for now. I am going to go take my meds.  Love yah all. :)
1	I sent replies to everyone who posted about our picture yesterday, but they haven't shown up in my LJ entry.   Did anyone get their reply?

0	had some cracking common room moments today. talking about how we would survive if all the students of wortley high were zombies and how we would use cups as weapons. daring each other to run to the canteen for food supplies. actually, that conversation lasted too long.  somebody at work thought i was a girl. he was like "excuse me love, i mean mate" i dont wanna be a girl, i wanna be a boy. then jemma at work said i was too ugly to be a girl. stupid wickes.  todays pic of the day should have been mel looking like a teapot but she made me delete it.
1	i have a                                BOOK   AWE [&lt;3] thanks sophie!!  and thanks natalie for askin' alycia for the book in case i need a back up.          my. that was a crappy update. sorry. being kicked off.

My boss dislocated her knee today so now i have to run everything.shit man and all i wanted to do was sleep. In better news my horse is coming along and I'm so happy.yep thats my life now.My horse you know why?cause he doesnt make me feel like shit.(dropping not so subtle hints)Like i'm not saying oh my life sucks cause it mostly doesnt.But I'm just getting rid of the problems.If you actuallycared you wouldnt say anything anyways.But whatever I'll be leaving soon enough.   Oh steph call me or something we need to go to the bar.I need to drink.

0	i'm going to D.C. today. will be back saturday i think but anyway thats cool. whats not cool is that i'm a terrible person....
1	This morning I was informed that my position as Senior Team Lead (Basically manager on duty - Opening & closing the store alone, as well as being the person in charge of everything much of the time) is now permanent.  Woohoo!  The reason my position has become permanent is because our store is going to be losing a hardlines executive (currently there are two) and I will be like the assistant manager to which ever exec stays.  (an exec position is the highest level before store manager in our company)   Needless to say, I&#8217;m pretty happy, as this provides a great opportunity for moving up in the company, should I choose to do so.  Otherwise It will be good for a resume.  That is all...   Oh, and my heat is back on in my apartment!  (Two weeks later!)

1	Well I've never had to ideas or motivation to do an LJ until today when I figured I should stop writing as Anonymous in people's journals and actually establish something like a name or a picture or even a song for people to look at and wonder if they know the lyrics.  So anyway, I'll update when something cool comes along.  Right now, I'm a tad tired from the gym and it's the clock's ticking towards sleepy time. I haven't done anything really interesting since the holidays. Heck, I might even recap my entire 8 weeks off from school for a bit of fun. Until then, I got nothing more to say.
1	okay im totally not a fan of a million updates a day, but i just talked to my mom and apperently my daddy won the lottery again!!  Like 2 years ago he won 26,000 and i guess the jackpot this time was 100,000.....BUT there was 4 winners.....so if you need me in the next few days, ill be hunting down tickets and burning houses :-p
1	I am now in my real room ... well technically - it's kate's and my room but as kate has been absent from our household for quite some time - I claimed it :D  I am only awaiting one bookcase/shelving to get into my room (which dad has to fix) so I can put all my dragons on it ... it is gnarly as but. I also have three beds now - so I can randomly change in the middle of the night ... and suchforth.  Very cool  Anyway - must be off ...
0	i hate myself alot sometimes.   today started out really nice...   now it sucks.

0	yeah so i'm actually writing a journal.  Work sucks.  The highlight of most of my days is getting off so i can come home and sleep so i can do it all over again the next day. I'm going to the dance with jenna.  Woo Hoo! umm other than that my life sucks and I don't really wanna be in it right now.

1	For now... I'm just going to post what I do in  Essay Cheese  just because I can.  I got to see A Christmas Carol at the Alley Theatre!!! It was awsome! The acting was awsome, the set was awsome, the costumes were awsome, the lighting was awsome, it was awsome in general! Freakin' awsome. I  love  A Christmas Carol  Mom and I left at around 1 (the play started at 14:30/2:30PM) and got there with few problems. Afterwards, we got lost trying to find our way out of the theater district, but managed to come upon a way out. Then we were stuck in traffic for a really long time.  We stopped by the house to pick up Dad and we all went out for some good 'ol Pizza Hut pizza, then came home and Mom and I watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It was... interesting, but not the most interesting thing."&gt;Essay Cheese . I don't really have anything else to say...
1	I feel so much better about everything, I think I'm actually doing the right thing this time.  Oh and my Semagic thing reminds me that Sara's birthday is tomorrow, which I knew but wouldn't have thought about in this post so, HAPPY PRE-BIRTHDAY VITAMIN S.  Get it because her last name's Vitale...Vitamin...yeah stfu  I think I've had Run Like Hell as my music within the last few posts but I don't curr.

Luv yah!
1	I am so fucking excited right now! I was talkin to my dad last night about cars I wanted. I'm over having an SUV. My first vehicle was a Denali,then I got the Escalade for my 18th...I just want a car...So he was asking me what I wanted and such and I said either a Mercedes or a BMW. He said he'd look into it. Well this morning,my Escalade is sitting downstairs in front of my building....sitting right next to a Z4 Roadster (BMW)....I about pissed my pants. Run downstairs and sure enough daddy is holding the key to MY very own car. Joe is stoked cuz he gets my Escalade. Dad called it an early performance gift. I love my parents soo much and I thank whoever it is out there lookin over us,cuz I'm definitely blessed and one very lucky girl. I don't wanna do anythign but cruise today dammit,but reality doesn't permit that! This weekend bitches!

1	I am an idiot! Ilost my keys to open the store today. I drove to work and am like shit I dont have any keys. So I panic and call everyone and nobody thats usally at the mall already.... had the day off. So i call my house and send my mommy and daddy on a mission to find them finally 15 minutes later they have been found. They were on the floor of my truck along with all my other stuff  that fell out of my purse a while ago. So i opened the store at 10. grrr then shit just kept happening.   I dont think i have been home really for about 2 or 3 weeks now i just sleep here and shower and am gone, so i realize that the house hasnt been cleaned except  the few times i did the bathrooms.The house is disgusting and dirty. Good thing i have tommorow off.   I need to see jaxsin, apperently he has a little friend that looks like him. hehehehe he has a mini him.   Had a good new years apart from some person....other than that had a good time!   anyways Happy New Years everyone.
1	I have been trying so hard to lose weight lately, and I felt like I have lost some. My clothes are looser. My sister reckoned I'd lost weight. So I went to try on a smaller pair of jeans from my cupboard and I couldn't even get them over my thighs. I was heartbroken. Truely devastated. After all this time I'm still caring so maternity weight.  Then I read the label, "height: 150cm". ie a childs height. They were childrens jeans! Not mine! (My Mother in Law arranged for a laundrymat to do some washing for me when I came out of hospital. We lost clothes, acquired others, many things ruined, etc)  I'm so happy I could cry. This might seem mindnumbingly boring to others but this is a huge issue with me. I'm starting to feel like a woman again instead of a mothership. *dances*
0	Called Mom today and told her the news.  I really should have told her in person, I guess.  She loves Kaga so much it wound up being a lot harder than I thought.  I still feel like it's my fault, somehow.  I hope he's at his parents' house but I'm a little too scared to call there.  I hope he's okay.  I never thought sleeping in an empty bed would bother me so much.  But I hate waking up alone.  I miss him so much...it's little things I didn't think were important.   I'm not pushing his hair out of my face when I sleep.  I can't tuck my cold toes under his leg when I sit on the couch.  Passing over his favorite tea at the grocery store was the hardest the other day.    On a slightly better note, Akuma-sensei is letting me stay with him right now.  The company has been really nice but I didn't realize he went out so often during the week.
1	 omg can u believe it? i havent updated in over&nbsp;a month! im so disappointed in myself...ok moving on...yay tomorrow im having friends over to play dance dance revolution and watch movies and hang out!! yay...wow im such a loser but thats ok...anyone that wants to come u should cuz i dont really know whos in town...i hope everyones having an awesome spring break! i know i am! except for last weekend wasnt much fun cuz i had a soccer tournament...and yeah we sucked a lot! but thats alright guys i know we can do better! and i know we are gonna do really good in state cup!! i hope...anyways im off now to go relax and then soccer practice at 6:15!!!

1	The date of the annual Bydgoszcz Opera Festival is approaching. It starts on April 23 and will last till May 8. I'm very excited about it, because during the Festival you can see various operas, musicals and ballets performed by groups from different theatres from Poland, but also other European countries.   This year the most interesting shows are probably going to be Verdi's  Othello ,  Chicago , a flamenco show performed by Ballet Flamenco de Andalucia and the Great Gala of the Russian Opera and Ballet. Unfortunately, I can't afford to see everything, so this year my my sister Dorota,       niniana   , my cousin Marta and I are going to see  Othello . We already booked the tickets, tomorrow Dorota will go to the opera house and pay for them. The show is going to be May 2nd. I can hardly wait!
0	I woke up on the wrong side of the Pottery Barn Charleston sofa today.  Tell me a story to cheer me up while I'm at class.
0	I got a new screen name, if anyone cares. Toasterjack fury. I'll probably use my old one just as much.
1	"Olivaudrita and Olga too" as  Teen Girl Squad :  BY AUDREY (      sordidsecret   ).           The funny thing is, the same time she was making those, I was making this, and neither of us knew it:       It's great because we match them perfectly. Audrey is great because she knows how to use photoshop much better than I do.
0	Last night I had the dream where I committed suicide again. But this time I saw your face in the reflection of my blood as I sucked it from my body. I understand now.
0	 I'm just so sad right now. My dear, dear friends just lost their baby...Mom was close to 6 months, but something went wrong that threatened her life (she has serious health issues to begin with), and baby had to go away. I've known the dad for many years, I know he's wanted to be a daddy for a long, long time. I know they both long to have a family more than anything. My heart  aches  for them.     I lost a baby a few years ago. I was 2.5 months along, and that was hard enough. But, to be nearly 6 months into a pregnancy and to be so excited to finally start a family (this couple got started late, they're in their mid to late 30s), to feel the little one growing and moving inside me, I can only partially fathom how devistating it would be.    I still cry for the loss of my baby sometimes.  It's devistating. 
1	ODAIJI NI SCREENSHOT RELEASE   http://members.aol.com/johna32545/odnpic.h tml   This will be the only screenshot release before the demo.  That is, unless you can wheedle more out of Charles; for that I suggest sexual favors personally...  The demo, which is already 2 weeks late, is now scheduled for Early March.  It will not, pictures to the contrary, feature a robot from Tribes II.

1	1. Who are you?  2. Are we friends?  3. When and how did we meet?  4. Do you have a crush on me?  5. Would you kiss me?  6. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it.  7. Describe me in one word.  8. What was your first impression?  9. Do you still think that way about me now?  10. What reminds you of me?  11. If you could give me anything what would it be?  12. How well do you know me?  13. When's the last time you saw me?  14. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't?  15. Are there any memories with me that stand out?  16. Have I impacted you?  17. Where do you see "us" in the near future?  18. Where do you see "us" in the distant future?  19. How often do I cross your mind?  20. Are you going to put this in your journal and see what I say about you?

0	...  There are simply no words for what has happened. And little Joanna, please don't think you need to sully your hands commenting on this post. I wouldn't want you to actually, you know,  care  about anything decent in this time of  tragedy .      I'm home in Newcastle for the duration... I may not return on time, depending on if Mum is too frightened to let me return. She overreacts at times.       Zacharias said he loved me. Although he was in grief over Professor Moody, I wonder if he means it. And it's positively AWFUL for me to be doubting what he said... but... I am an awful awful girlfriend. I can't... even comfort my own boyfriend.   I hope you're hexing those rogue dustbins in the sky Professor Moody
0	For those of you who may not have heard yet,  Dimebag Darrell has been murded .  Shit.  That's fucked up.  I've actually been cranking alot of Pantera recently, and reminding myself of how much they rocked, and what a great axeman Dimebag was.  And then this happens.  Bleah.  DIMEBAG!
1	This week was/has been awesome! I just thought that I would share. :) 
1	I have an interview at Best Buy tomorrow.. I hear if they hire me as seasonal, my discount will take effect immediately.  That would make this season of holidays/birthdays a little easier to manage.  Friday was really stressful for several reasons but when I finally made it home, Mike had beautiful flowers (a dozen roses- red, white, yellow, and orange), a Gir plush, and a big bottle of bubble bath waiting for me.  He ran my bath while I ate dinner and read to me while I soaked.  He had even scrubbed the tub clean before I got home!  Saturday we saw Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and shopped.  Two pairs of pants, six shirts, and boxers for Mike at Old Navy (he bought me pj pants with pumpkins!!!) and a shower curtain and a super warm blanket at Kmart.    That's all I've got.
0	My sister (not my sister by birth but one of two women who are much more than "close friend" to me) is pregnant again.   Second kid.  Baby is due soon.   Her sister is going to have a baby shower for her.    I don't know if I can go to this.  I really don't.  I know she'd understand.  But then comes the time when I have to deal with me and she's always been there.   I also know that she doesn't want a baby shower...she thinks it is stupid for a second baby, baby shower.   I don't know.   My sweetie was trying to help me by saying we'll be away...but I can't lie.  I can say "I couldn't deal." and she'll understand that...but lying...no.   Sigh.  Hate this.
0	          &nbsp;     well, its not much, but...       &nbsp;      &nbsp;     why?      That's what i have to ask.      i just don't understand it      sometimes i feel hidden      almost like I'm wearing&nbsp;a mask       &nbsp;     why?      why won't it just happen?      why can't you just understand?      this is one of the most complicated things right now.      I just want to hold your hand       &nbsp;     why?      we have so much in common.      we look up at the same night sky      we look down at the sane earth      we look around at the same settings      truly, what am i worth?       &nbsp;     why?      this situation is driving me insane      why?!&nbsp;i just ask why!      but apparently i just don't deserve your heart.       &nbsp; 
0	  I'm so sick of everything. I am tired of being stupid and slow in magic. I am tired of living with people who are perfect and don't understand me. I'm sick of always being in the background. I'm sick of getting readings from Sybill every week, and her still not knowing that I exist. I need to change something, but I don't know how.  Sometimes I think that the Sorting Hat is evil. I have not done one brave thing in my entire LIFE, SO WHY AM I IN GRYFFINDOR?  Ten hours 'till class and my slipper is still not alive, much less cute and furry. I can't stand Transfiguration sometimes.
1	Tee-hee, tonight I have an intake for a job! I'm so damn nervous! Baby-sitting!   Yesterday, Tuut, Esther, Rogier and me went to "De Lazarus" and had some beers, later on we took an ice-cream!

Today I went to Riagg again, it's a mental health institution, I'm going to have two tests, a personality test and a psychologie test... pretty heavy...  Oh well :)
0	I feel depressed for some reason. For reasons I won't state, I feel...I dunno, empty, or something. I look at my calendar and realize I'm almost 20 and that the only impressive thing I've done so far in my life is shoot a smiley face onto a target's head on the firing range. That, and realizing that I'm still alive after all the crap that's happened to me. I wonder what's gonna happen when my luck runs out. What's next after that? I dunno...
0	UPDATE: www.uknova.com is still up. Don't know what is going on.  I'm very sad that  UKnova  has died - news I found out thanks to       lauralorien   . Where will I get my Channel 4 fix from now? No more hard-find programmes! No more sneering at people who haven't watched Casanova on BBC3! Thank God I got to see the new series of Shameless and thanks again to the kind UKnova person who read this journal and posted the BBC documentary on the Congo for me. The kindness of internet strangers is a fine thing. UKnova, God bless her and all who sailed along with her. RIP.

1	Well, I'll be making my first campaign stop at F. D. Roosevelt Public School today. Hmm. A Canadian school named after an American president. That's a bit unusual. Anyway, their librarian came into the book store on Saturday and asked me if I was the author of 'The Princess Pawn'. I said yes and then she asked to shake my hand. Apparently, she has a Red Maple Club at her school and reads the books right along with the students (don't you just *love* teachers like that!). And they had just finished reading 'The Princess Pawn' and all the kids had really enjoyed it. So, I mean what could I do? I offered to come in and chat with them.  Don't think I've ever been in a room full of kids before where every single one of them has read my book. I think it will be fun (and secretly believe that I should be paying *them*).

0	I could have done alot of things different, ya know.  I could have said nothing, when I said way too much.  I could have been less sympathetic for things I didn't understand, other than acting like I was sorry for a story I didn't know anything about.  I should have accepted what she told me, and not pressed an issue that wasn't my business.  I could have done alot of things different.  She amazes me, simply because there's times she reads me like a book, when I can't even grace the cover.  That's just... something I'm usually very good at, reading people.  But man, did she ever humble me.  I could have done alot of things different, though.  A whole lot of things different.  And, just like the song says 'people say they wouldn't change a thing, even if they could, oh but I would.'  You're damn right I would.  I'd have stopped this whole mess from ever happening.

Hibbett and the Validators, "Easily Impressed"  Others are unwell today.  I want to, and somewhat have, been there for them.

1	Wow, it's been a while since I updated this thing. Here goes...  - I can still play Usher's "Yeah".  - Went to Ireland and Italy over Spring Break. Saw Andrea, Yael, Katy, Melissa, and Elms. Twas awesome.  - Back at Vassar. Still stressed with work. May die.  - My house got TA 52 for house draw next year. Score.  - Currently reading people's screenplays.    That's all I got for now.    Oh, new Fall Out Boy rules.
1	So there you have it.  Pretty neat huh?   Didn't think that was going to happen like that.  Everyone confused yet???  good cause you'll have to figure it out on your own, MWAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHA!!!  &lt;---more evil laughing.
1	San Diego was fun. Vacation is over. Misery begins. =D  School is incredibly hard this semester. I'm taking:  - Veterinary Medical Nursing - Veterinary Pharmacology - Veterinary Radiology - Physiology of Domestic Animals - ... and Work Exp. at a Horse Hospital  D: The guy who teaches all the classes (except work exp. and physiology) is a Vet and he's particularly picky and hard.  Love my physiology teacher though, I had him for Anatomy and he's cool.  Radiology is really fun though, and I've already got to operate the machine and develop film.  Pharmacology is hard, math, drug memorization unhappiness. As the vet put it, "...this class is probably fun if your taking the drugs we talk about" LOL XD Ok it was funny in class but it sounds corny now.  I've been tired this whole week, and right now is no exception.
0	Came home from work and found one of my fish doing the backstroke of doom.  My mutant color-changing overgrown goldfish is no more. R.I.P. Flash.  And now Pumpkin and Catbait look so lost in that big tank all alone...  And I am oddly sad over the death of a creature that I couldn't cuddle that did nothing but eat, poop, and spit gravel at the side of the tank all night.  Probably just depression from the reality of having to move out of the house I've lived in my whole life in another month setting in, but still...  It hurt to give him the flush.
0	I have a feeling that Kikyou's dinner guest was Inuyasha.  I thought it was strange the other night that he seemed eager for me to get my homework done.  I think that was the same night that Kikyou had her dinner guest.  She said they had ramen for dinner and I know how much Inuyasha loves ramen.  *looking sad*  I might be wrong, but I think it was him.

This is phenomenal news, especially for you; no matter what Lizzy says - can I call her that?  Thanks - there's just no way she's okay with this whole thing.  She'll live to be 120 if it means the crown can go directly from her to you.  Congratulations!    &nbsp;     Apropos of nothing, by the way - I look great in a crown.  Really.

1	First of all, let me say thank you for the wonderful birthday wishes and cards that I have gotten today.  That really made my day sparkly!  And then spending the whole day with Kevin, on this 15th anniversary of the day he asked me to marry him, well, that was pretty special too.  And then we went out to the most wonderful dinner, at a restaurant right on the lake, it was beautiful!  And coming home I found a box on my door step.  Wrapped in a heating pad!  Fresh, live plants, it said.  And it was GORGEOUS!  A super cute birthday bear and a potted kalanchoe.  Oh my gosh!  From       maliwane   , the darling!  And tomorrow morning its off to       darthhellokitty   's and       kingchiron    with       lauriejantzer   .  And then off to Escapade, my very first ever!  I am just bubbling with WAY too much excitement!    And now I must run, cause Mrs. Laurie is here, and I am being a bad hostess!
1	I just want to say Happy 23rd Birthday to my wonderful boyfriend Alex!!!  Now I get to fully enjoy dating an older man for five whole months until I turn 23 too.  It is very exciting.  Also, today just happens to be our 15 month-iversary.  It feels like a lot longer than 15 months because I honestly don't remember a time anymore when we weren't dating, or at least secretly crushing on each other over Circuits homework.  Babe, you rock.  On another notes, it is almost Christmas vacation time!!!  I have three and a half days more to go, then I'm free!!!!  Happy Birthday again handsome!!!!
0	Dear Emily, Stupid medical sites don't help at all. -_- I've been looking through one for the past hour or so and it just keeps repeating the same stuff over and over again. I don't want to have to go see a doctor if I don't have to. I -hate- doctors. *shudders* But everything on the damn site is so brief that I can't glean any real information off of it. O_o Sure, it has 8,000 pages to check. But each page says the same thing! Gzzrrrr.... I really, really hate my body. -_- I need to find some place that will let me trade it in for a new model. *sighs*  Heather

And now i have plans for tonight with the lovely       djtatsu   ...   *bounces*   I don't know about dancing but... i should be out at the 'no tonight. :)     PS: on a creative note - i started to paint the designs on the outer box of bronze gold clouds on a black background. Not sure how well it will go with the insides since i have no idea of what to do on the inside but there you go.   also i have the phrase "sea of glass" stuck in my head and the images are ... mmm... tantalizing me with a story possibly? a something... i will probably work on it later tonight.
0	Real Life kicks me in the butt.  Tuesday the 15th we are taking my Grandpap to be addmited to the nurseing home. He has gotten to the point where he needs more care then we can give him. The place we chose has a good dementia unit. While I am glad he will be better cared for it's sad to have to put him in a home.    My Aunt went back home and will be back to go with us. Mom and I are going to have to get him packed. He won't want to go and that's going to be the hardest part. I don't know what we are going to do with his dog. Max will go nuts when he leaves, probably cry all night - all week. I don't think we are going to be able to keep him.     So I am a little depressed and a lot stressed. I really, REALLY need something to cheer me up. I want something humorous, light-hearted, maybe a little romance (a little smutt). Got a suggestion? Write me something?

1	 ONE MORE DAY UNTIL VEGAS!   In the grand scheme of things, I am *not* most excited about Vegas.  I am most excited about seeing Bloc Party tonight at the Metro.        katmaloney    brought the album back from her trip to Wales and burned Mike and me a copy.  It sounds like The Killers' and Elbow's love child, I suppose I could say.  Either way it's a great album and I'm sure it will be an awesome show; it's sold out, so we're planning to get there early.  It'll be an awesome way to start off my four-day weekend.  Okay, so I'm *MOST* excited about getting two days off of work.  Woo no work!  On an unrelated note, also check out The Bravery's new album.  Think Bloc Party, but dancier.  Their sing "Public Service Announcement" would have been a number one hit at discos if it had been released in the 1970's.
0	The saying “We’re more likely to hate people than we are to love them” has been so vividly present in my life. For some strange reason I hated all dates I had in the past six months and the very idea of dating someone now seems so oddly uninteresting. I surely have never been the kind of guy who can easily get along with his dates and end up in love with them but I at least used to find joy in the chase for “true love”.   The latest urge to date people I had probably has rooted in the need of pleasing my body because I can’t imagine myself hoping for love after so much frustration this year. I’ve finally realized I can’t find happiness in a relationship with a pseudo-prototype of the partner I idealize and neither can I have sex with someone I don’t fully am interested in, that is, both physically and psychologically. I wonder if all this hate has come as a result of my defeat in finding someone right or if I simply don’t have anything else to give in return.

0	Yeah, back now.  That's all.  I found no answers, which bothers me, naturally, but what bothers me more is that I did see that no amount of thinking can find answers to the questions before me concerning my future.   I think.. I need sleep, most of all.  The majority of my "negative posts" do occur at nighttime. Toodles!
1	Heather and Ray are gettin married this Saturday....ohhh man.  I am so excited for the wedding. i am completely gonna cry. Shane has to get a tux. I think that is kind of funnie that we are gonna see him in a Tux, i mean itz Shane. But a tux looks great on anyone....except girls lol...and possibly cory.   I had the worst time trying to find a dress. heather wants it to be purple but i can't find one! so she said dark blue is ok and i have that. so now i am all good. i even made a hair appointment to get my hair curled. i know i know, it sounds weird but my curls are just crazy this will make em look more natural and nicer. i figured if i wear my hair down it will cover my ears and piercings so it looks more formal.  Heathers dress is absolutely gorgeous. i love it!  tomorrow night is her Bachelrette party! we hired a stripper to come. he is dressing up like a cop!! i have to get some bills changed so i can tip him in his g string hahahaha  oi i am so tired from a long day i'm out

0	This day has to be with out a doubt the worst day of the entire year and quite possibly of my entire high school life. Here's what happened:  1. Ran my car in to the side of my garage (don't ask). 2. I sat all day trying to think of ways of telling my parents about the car. 3. I found out that I have a 77 semester average in fucking calculus. 4. I was almost hit by a run down truck in the parking lot. They weren't watching when they backed out, almost right in to me! 5. I chipped one of our dinner plates. 6. My dad was pissed off about the car and didn't talk to me for like four hours. 7. None of my fics were updated. 8. I fucking couldn't stop crying. 9. No friend seemed to be home, or at least not answering their phone.  what the hell is happening with my life? Did hell break loose and someone forget to tell me?!
1	*sigh* i wanted to find a breed of cat in japan that suites me, but they dont have any that i could find, except the japanese bobtail. if i go with that, ill give it a dragon tail. even if that kind of takes the name away. i dont know what to do. i like tigers, but i dont think its me. if you can help out feel free to sujest things

1	If I get hired tomorrow at this interview, I'm going to the Devil Rays game tomorrow! That's how broke I am-$5 tickets are not sold out (!!) and the only way I'm going is if I get this damn job. They're not going to be the best seats-but they are seats at an opening day game. And I've never been to one. Who cares if they're playing the Blue Jays. Hell, if I get this job I'll probably buy season tix. ;) Poor Rays-their attendance is so low that they practically give tickets away.
1	We had a great time tonight.   I admit that I was kind of expecting amateur night, and I mostly went because it's a Common Ground fundraiser thing, but it ended up being really, really good. We laughed a lot, and I got to get to know the_surfacer a little better, which was a pleasure.   My sweetie will be here tonight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!

Just kidding. Did I ever mention how much I didn't like Mrs. Mccosh? Okay. WHY DOES SHE HATE ME!! I didn't   ever   do anything to her. Just because I prove her wrong every once and a while doesn't mean she should hate me. I   don't   know everything, and neither does she. I'm in CBA right now. Kinda boring but not horrible. Better than WORLD HISTORY. I used to love World History...'til this year. *Sigh, Well I have go to now so bye bye.       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIC, Holly  
1	We had our first exam this morning, zoology, i woke up at 5am (not intentional!!!) and studied until it was time to the classroom. And i really studied for no reason, the exam was so easy!!! If i hadn't studied at all i would probably have passed it!! What a waste of time! Tomorrow we have anatomy, that will be a different thing, we have to know like every structure, and every little bump on every bone of cat, dog and horse. Trust me it's terrible!!! You want to take care of an animal, you have to know it!!:-/   And i'm finally really together with my love, god i love him so much!!!! He's so sweet and gentle and everything!!! But it's hard, because now with the exams and everything, we can't be together very often!  Still no art done, well i made a sketch last week, i'll try to upload it this weekend!  Which me luck!

1	I don't have too much time. I have to wake up in 6 hours. But I just wanted to talk about this evening... Diep invited Clement, Aurélie and I. She made us Asian food(That was veeery good!!!). And we were together, speaking about everything... just like before. And I felt so good with them... We often were together in the past. Our lives have changed but i think we will always be linked... Today is a proof that it always be like it always was. I mean that our behaviours are still the same as before. I love them(and I guess we love one another...) and it's really hard to explain... I must go to sleep...
1	Hello everyone!! I have been a Bing fan all my life, I think he is the most amazing person. I am glad to see a community here for him!
1	I can't believe it, ask a few people about an opinion on a matter expeting just a few comments and I get a lot of positive advice, blows my mind! People I never met are here giving me great supportive advice.
1	Well, here it is. A new year! And what a new year it is going to be. I officially proposed to my girlfriend this morning. Less than an hour into the new year. She cried but of course said "yes". Now we have to continue going through mounds of paperwork to change her status and get a Green Card. We are going to try doing it on our own ... it doesn't seem TOO bad. We also have to fill out the marriage license stuff and get that ball rolling. Oh yeah and we have to find/buy a house. Then we have to plan at least 2 trips this year. One, a cruise with my family to the Cayman Islands and two, a trip to Indonesia to meet her family. She hasn't been home for two years and will be bringing a husband. I'm sure that is going to be an emotional trip for everyone. What a new year indeed.
1	Well, I got my paper back today in English, and that brought my grade up to a B+. I still have a C in Spanish, despite getting an 85 on my 2nd exam...all because of that bitch who doesn't know how to grade. I swear if I don't get a good grade on my taped role play I will flip...especially if my partner gets a much higher grade than me. As far as tonight goes, I'm going to ATTEMPT to make my nerves go away...not sure how I did it last time, although I think playing mad has something to do with it...so that should be fun :-D. I'm trying to be positive! :)
1	Today was fun. After tkd demo practice. I went to eat lunch at Venus Cafe. I saw Robert, not sure if he saw me. lol Then left early and went to RPM for Howdy's b-day...and it goes on... met jenny and vivianne (sp?) Weird sister-like girls they are. Ate dinner, then came back. hehe The highlight of the day was my progress in KBM. I can play mostly any song in light+ mode and starting to get into "real" mode =D  O yea, I also got 256 more megs of ram. Now I have 512. Goodbye lag =P
0	Well, it's over. Sean and I finished watching the whole damn season of Azumanga Daioh.  It took a long time, but it was well worth to watch every episode.  I almost cried at the end and if I was by myself, I would have.  It was sad to see all my friends, Tomo, Sakaki, Chiyo, Osaka, Yomi and Kagura go off to university together.  It was nice to see their entire high school lives in 26 eps of fun and I'll miss them all very much.    I hope that someday we'll all get to see their post-secondary hijinks.  That would be amazing.  Well, for any who want to borrow them, I have the three DVDs for the whole season... just ask, but take care of them!!
0	Me. I got in to a fight in my dream last nite. I was scary. Maybe it's just what I needed. Maybe it's what I deserve.  Fuck.
1	I found my ring, thank god, I was so worried I would never see or wear it again. I have had that ring since I was 18 and the thought of it being gone forever made me sad and angry at myself for loosing it.  That's one less thing I have to worry about.  I am doing the happy dance right now.  I came back from class and stopped by the apartment office and the secretary said they had found it on the floor.  I really must learn to not take it off my finger unless I am in the apartment. Whatever, its fine, not dented and in the same condition as when I took it off. Wish  that was all I had to do today, but unfortunatly my class has a movie I must go see at the TLC tonight.  And of course a three page essay must be written about it which is due the 13th.  Joy of joys.
1	Well, looks like there's officially nothing left to keep me here anymore. Not even the slightest hope of a best friend. The next step is to close down my email accounts and delete this LiveJournal. I don't know how soon that will be. But once it happens, that's when I will no longer be online for at least 2 years...
1	So I've decided to be a mortician before I do the dental assistant dealy.   Somewhere in there I'm squeezing in cosmetology and nude photography...but first and foremost, the mortuary.  yay ¦ )

1	Oh I cannot say what I'd do without Lathrion around...   I had been so saddened by Endea's departure, and his decision not to return to us... I had lost all inspiration to sew or any of the like! I would just sit there, staring at untouched threads and fabric... nothing would come to me. I could think of nothing to create. I had no motivation to alter or mend... it was quite a pathetic state.  I was sitting beneath one of the beeches one evening when Lathrion found me. The poor dear had hand-dyed fabrics for me! His stained fingers were like little trophies of his work. That he did such a thing for me... it lifted my spirits out of their dark hiding place. I want to make something perfect out of this cloth... It's from the heart, I assuredly will put all of my own heart into it.

1	I bring a small sampling of teh hot cowboys. ;)  Preview:                              X-posted:       mag7fans   ,       los_magnificos   ,       xtrustno1x   
0	So, Matt got a job for the summer at Polaris, which is like his dream job, so I am very happy for him.  But then I found out Polaris in in Minneapolis, MN and the job goes from May-December!!  I am so sad, I am hardly going to see him in the next 7 months, this summer is gonna suck sooo bad!!!
0	I have reached the overload point with my thesis. More explanation, my advisor says. I open the document, skim, and want to weep because it's all perfectly obvious. It's all right there. How much more clear can I be? "Just war is important to my thesis BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT WAR IN THE MIDDLE AGES WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT JUST WAR." I don't make this shit up, people. I write a whole page about how important just war is, how it is the go-to issue for every single discussion about restraint of war in the Middle Ages, I write ten pages about evolving concepts of just war with special emphasis on their  jus ad bellum  aspects, I footnote the hell out of it, and HOW AM I POSSIBLY NOT MAKING MYSELF CLEAR?  I have to drive people to the barn today. I'm going to curl up in a corner of Sly's stall and whimper for the jello that is my brain while he checks back every five minutes to see if treats have magically appeared in my pockets. He's a smart one, that horse.  I fucking hate my thesis.
1	It's really amazing how someones day can turn around so fast, and by one person. I'm not going to tell you all the gory details :) but you know who you are. You might not know what you did, but I know you know who you are. :-D
1	This past weekend, I was mistaken for Lord Sterling.  I forget the name of his Household.  I think it has something to do with a Kraken.  He is a Great guy and I look forward to seeing him at pennsic.
1	Olson twins are legal, finally we can stop hiding our love.  And now I can release that sex tape without having to go to jail, at least not for sex with minors.  Plenty of other reasons  Been seeing a girl name Jen very casually amongst friends.  Gonna go out alone.  Kind of like her. Hope things work well.  School sucks, work rocks, new hair cut is. . . interesting.  Thats all I've got and I ain't got no more
1	I am the new owner of a White 2002 Subaru WRX with 26,000 miles on it. Feels good to finally have a car that can keep up with my friends. Now if only I can free up some cash for a carbon fiber hood and carbon fiber STI wing. But got alot of other shit that needs to get done before that I guess. Ah well, I gotta work in a few hours so I should get some sleep.  w00t
1	The roster seems to be as follows:     Dancougar GoShogun Evangelion Ideon Gaogaigar Virtual On Marz Virtual On Oratario Tangram Daitarn 3 Z Gundam Gundam 0083 ZZ Gundam Char's Counter Attack Gundam Wing Endless Waltz Gundam Seed Mazinger Z Great Mazinger Getter Robo Getter Robo G Shin Getter Robo Koutetsu Jeeg Combattler V Voltes 5 Daimos Gaiking Raideen Gunbuster Macross Macross Plus Macross 7 Banpresto Origionals   Hopefully, with people such as Ideon, Gunbuster and Dancouga appearing, as well as EVA, we will get re-F/Final.  Ideon vs. SRX  You the viewers decide!
1	Wheeee!  I found my passport after a year and half of wondering where the heck I had put it after I moved into my current apartment.  (Apparently I'd put them with my formerly treasured set of admissions letters to graduate school, hahaha.)  This means that I may a) go check out Canada before deciding to move there *g*, or at least go pick up a Kalan Porter CD for non-insane import prices, b) go visit my brother who is studying aboard in Europe, and c) consider spending next summer in China to polish up my sucky Chinese.
1	So i am now officially full time at my work, wich means that after 4 and a half years i finally get vaction time.  To celebrate this i'm trying to gather as many people as possible to go out Saturday januray 15th and have a good time, not sure yet where but i'll figure that out.  If interested in celebrating this with me you can leave a comment or give my cell a call(604)762-4970.
0	People do really fucked-up things when they're in love.  Stel got the bloody cops looking for her all over the country. I don't even want to know what was going through her brain.  I don't really want to talk about her. Most of my serious journal entries have had something to do with her, and she's not really what my life is about.  I'm terrified that when she comes home she'll need me to be there, be her...what? Confidante? Lover? I know I will, and that might result in an obsession for her as deep as the one she has for this man of hers.  Anyway, the upshot of it all is that I met a nice cop, and I'm not sure I can trust my mother.  In other news, I'm bored as hell, but I do so love cable.
1	A very quick catch-up:  Now that I've handed in my Java coursework, I can happily say goodbye to semester 1 and look forward to semester 2, which so far it seems will involve some african cows, some mice and trips to Liverpool, all tied together with google (more about this another time, perhaps when I understand it all), oh and quite a bit of work.   And maths.  Again.  The laundry is still broken, which is annoying.  My first attempt at rice crispie cakes were a bit soft but still nice.  Aikido has been good fun.  I've been very busy and life has been good.
0	This weekend was pointless. Aside from going to a band contest in Larimore on saturday and wasting four hours of my life, I haven't left the house. At least it's only a four day week.
1	ok ive been meaning to say this for a while now...i really hate it when people photoshop my pics! ok enough on that rant.
1	Today went pretty well, I think.  I had a mild crisis because my husband announced we were out of fruit but I think I will get through it ; ).  Will have to get some more tomorrow.  Food:  WW pita with tuna and mayo salad and romaine salad with feta, carrots, seeds, light dressing (hereafter known as *the usual suspects* because this is what I almost always have on my salad and I dont want to type it out all the damn time!)  baked lays sour cream and onion  2 black bean burritos (ww torialls with an onion, garlic, spices and black bean mixture and some grated cheddar)  about 10 almonds, one small chocholate chip cookie, two spoons of ice cream from the container (if this is what a binge looks like these days I wont fret too much over it!  I am happy with myself for not having more cookies or ice cream...)
1	This past week has been a taste of how i hope it will be all summer.  i wish that i could describe it :)
0	  Tough lil bastard, isn't it.  My heart hasn't broken, but it seems to have developed some rather unhandsome cracks.  -David
0	My roomie used my computer again without permission and downloaded something with a virus and it totally crashed my computer.  bye bye to EVERYTHING!  But I think it's fixed now.  I'm almost done my 3rd year now.  This is weird because I bunch of my friends are graduating and moving off to various places, and it's kinda sad to know that I might not ever see them again.  It won't be the same.    My jerk roommate that uses my computer is done this year.  At least that's good news - I'll have a couple new roomies for next year.  Part of me wishes I just did the 3 year program, but I guess in the long run, it will be better to have the Honours degree.  I suppose.  I dunno.  All week there have been going away parties for people that are leaving next week.  It's really depressing.  Just thinking about the fact that I might not ever see these people again is making me really sad.  I think I'm going to cry.
1	  'ink has been dripping from my fingers, onto this blank piece of paper, creating lyrics, poems, thoughts, emptying my heart, feeling so much better, so much happier...'     well nothing much has been going on, still the same routine, work-gym-home-sleep. been hanging out with 2 great girls:) never know what might happen ...*wink wink*     the irish&nbsp;selection went good last saturday, didn`t get picked but got great  free  stuff. going back next year. meet new people, one girl i`m sure she`s into girls. had a blast with val,   shopping  -couldn`t stop laughing.    good stuff!    &nbsp; 
1	I spent last night cuddling with Mark.  Holy hottness Batman!  Yeah it was great.  Cuddling is great.  I'm going to keep him in my pocket forever and ever and ever!!!
1	*brushes dust off LJ* Cannot believe how bad I've been, not one post in 7 months? Suppose I've been in a rut; actually a bit embarassed to post after letting so much time go by. Then again, life's pretty ordinary, so couldn't think of things to post about. :b  Pumpkin Pie chat tonight definitely inspired me to go ahead and post. Reminded me how much I loved just keeping up with you guys, just chatting about Harry & Co. Am really just bursting with happy feelings from chat. ^_^  It is pretty late around here though, so shall keep it short (and thus semi-coherent). Will post again, soon! :D
1	Everyone pull a chair up  Its a party Dont make it wait You musn’t be tardy  Open your eyes  Close your mouth Look into the skys As everything falls down  Make sure not to blink You dont want to miss a drop Stare into the abyss Listen as it drops  It will fall for days But only in your memory Dont miss the sudden waves  Of rains sheer extacy

1	 Yay! Today is Alarm für Cobra 11!   My mistake.. Forgot that today is wednesday. Yay! Today is Stargate: Atlantis!
0	Thursday night: lame. Friday night: great. Saturday night: lame. though a lot of that is my fault.
1	Last night was too funny to say the least...  Started out by going to dinner with Ally for vietnamese food. OMG that place was so great! You're right, we are SO hanging out more when you come back from the whirlwind that is Jimmy Buffett! Why was Urban Outfitters so much cooler back then lol.  Then I headed over for what was supposed to be Poker night or not so much. It ended up only being three of us. So what did we do? We hit the bars! "Never knew you liked fat chicks so much." "I swear 'Barbie' was there." "Is that Neil singing? I got a 'hey' so I've got the in!" "Don't let your beautiful angel slip away." "I told you there was a plant in the bathroom." "I'm not single but I know a great girl who is." Of course I'll come out again! Just call me lol.  Don't know if I'm up for the plan today but we'll see....  Finally can get some relief from these allergies today. I hope...  Got a great email this morning which was just what I needed. I miss you baby :-(
1	         You Are the Enthusiast                 7          You are outgoing and playful - always seeing the happy side to life.  You're enthusiastic and excitable. You love anything new.  Multi-talented, you do many things well... and find success easy.  You prefer to keep things light with others. Opening up is hard for you.          What number are you?      THAT'S MY NUMBER! how cool is that? i'll tell you, way awesomely cool! lol GROUP CHRISTMAS PARTY TOMORROW!! YAY! I CAN'T WAIT!! I miss my gurls, and we shall all be there! YAY!
1	All I can say is damn Nathan Smith.  I won one against him at a party but what really matters is he won this one
1	well at heathers house with heather, colt, cory, cody going to soak city and kims comeing really excited by
1	ooookay.  school is scaring me.  project was due last friday, test today, quiz tomorrow, test the day after tomorrow, big project due the day after that, rough draft of another project due in a week, ew.  it's all accumulating but i don't care, i just keep watching that sex and the city...  listening to that music... eating that food... mwahahahahahha.  other than that, all systems are goodo.  :)
0	Oh, great. My life is getting worse by the minute.  In an attempt to improve our financial situation in order to apply for a loan for my Mexico trip sometime around November of December, my parents are turning off all the features on our cellular phone service EXCEPT the basic phone service, so that means no more wireless Internet, no more text messages, and no more pictures messages.  Also, they're turning off digital cable in our house, so all we'll have are the basic 70 channels.  If going to Mexico means being bored out of my mind for the next 8 months, I question whether it is worth going.  Anyone have a sharp object?
0	Does anyone else feel like I do? Sometimes, maybe it's a song, or a part of a movie or TV show... sometimes it just comes over you. You glimpse something that you want, or wish you had, or maybe you did for awhile, but then lost it. Something that you can see but not be a part of, no matter how much you try. Sometimes it's a person, sometimes a relationship, sometimes a group, or event. But regardless of what it is, it always seems to be passing me by, while I sit here, helpless. Sometimes I get tired of trying to be so positive.  You know, when I first started this thing I told myself that I wouldn't use it like everyone else (i.e. crying about how bad life is.) But for some reason, while you sit on the computer by yourself at 4 in the morning, it seems like one of the only things you can do.
0	I'm very disappointed about a lot of things in my life right now.   Certain individuals.  Specific circumstances.  Various scenarios.    I don't want to offend anyone.   So let's just leave it at that.
1	so happy to..... menyambut ramadhan kali ini ga tau kenapa lain dari yang sudah sudah ada pengharapan yang........  ada niat yang......  pokoknya seneng banget bisa ngerasain ramadhan dengan gembira kaya gini.....
1	And I'm attacking his leg!  He said  "Cat, we do not eat our friends' legs," but I think he's just not used to seeing me around.  He just said something about destroying Mommy's shiny silver box with all the colors, but I don't see why that's a big deal.  Anyway, he's picking me up and giving me treats while Mommy types this for me, so I'm happy.  Maybe he'll get mad at me, yell, then feel bad and give me a treat like Mommy does.
1	I'm dead jealous of all you Hogwarts students that get to go to this Halloween Ball. It sounds like a lovely excuse to get dressed up.  It's my sister's birthday on Halloween so I will be with my family in Somerset.   It's not such a nice excuse to get dressed up cos I hate family parties. My Aunt Doris will be there cos she hasn't seen Abigail since she got engaged and I'll have to listen to all the reasons why I'm not as good as my sister, at anything. My Uncle Byron will be there too, cos Doris doesn't go anywhere without him. He'll be drunk of course and start asking me if I've got a boyfriend yet and if not why not. He may even go as far as to ask if I even like boys. He almost asked me that last time, until Aunt Gertie hit him with her umbrella and told him not to be so rude. I always liked Aunt Gertie.
0	finding love at UCSC is like trying to find a penguin in the sahara desert.     I'm not happy right now....
1	     The Misfits are some kinda love     Imlikeyesss.
1	i just landed here two hours ago, and ive been awake for about 24 hours straight and i feel very weird. this feels all like a dream.   anyways, i forgot my phone book in israel, and i apologize, but i dont remember most of your phone numbers, so if you want to contact me you can e-mail me or reply. my cousins moved, so you wouldnt be able to reach me there. and i dont want to post their phone number publicly. im probably only gonna be here for about a week or so cause im going down to miami or new orleans or something later, and have a trip. i might come back for a couple of days afterward though.   im not sure about anything right now, it'll be mostly spontaneous.   LOVE ALL!  toar.
1	went to church being the wonderful pastor's daughter that i am  to lunch w/ lyndsey! GREAT!  to sean's and hung out with sean, dave, and joey....

OH! and i also loved the shaving cream fight!!! CRAZY! those of you who weren't there... wow... you missed it...hehehe   With all my heart and more.
1	It's been a pretty fun, pretty wild week. I just got back from the wedding of one of my best friends, just in time to go to the baptism of my old choir director's kid. Yay for special events that actually mean something! Bachelor party was strange; we watched "Kill Bill 2" and it took us four hours because people kept talking and so we kept pausing the movie while people were being loud. Then we ALMOST cut the wedding cake with one of the dinky plastic knives like everyone had at their place settings... someone found a real knife at the last minute, curse them.  In other news, "Escanaba in the Moonlight" is one messed up movie.

1	Ok, ok, ok, for all you comic books fans out there, check this shit out:   A Neil Gaiman comic book movie!!   And the best part is:  "A popular figure with his expansive fanbase and a regular at Comic-Con, Gaiman's appearance this year is in support of Mirror Mask, an intricate film project he's working on with director  Dave McKean  and the  Jim Henson Company  that is many years in the making."  Dear god, I almost creamed myself.  On a different note: All you EC, FF, LW, and anyone else getting really effected by these storms, can you give me a call and let me know everyone is safe? 561 351 4102. Thanks =)
1	A while ago, my father gave me his old Palm III when his employer bought him a brand new PDA for use in his job. While it is rather out of date, it was quite useful in demonstrating to me that I would indeed use the thing on a regular basis. So the other day, I found a Tungsten T on eBay, and was able to get it for about a hundred bucks  including  shipping. It's not as fully-featured as the newest models, but it does have Bluetooth. Other stuff, like a built-in digital camera, would be nice, but isn't necessary.  And now I'll be able to check out a bunch of stuff that just won't run on an old, slow, black&white Palm. Including many games. Not that that's the only reason I'm getting it. Of course not.
1	Brandon deploys March 1st, the plane leaves around 1300. Tomorrow he's done by 1100 and then we have the weekend together. Monday he doesn't have P.T. and then Tuesday he's leaving. So, that's that.   We got a new car, it's a 01 Toyota Corolla with around 50K miles on it. We did a really good job talking them down on the price so we feel like it was a great buy. Oh, and it's silver, (I'm pretty sure...)  I went to a meeting for perspective employees at PetsMart last night. There are five available positions, two are cashier positions and three are in the specialty department, which would be dealing with the live animals they sell there. So I hope I get that job.   Well Brandon's home now, so I'm off to be with him!
1	She's not going to see this due to real life interference, but am posting it anyway because she deserves public birthday greetings.  So without further ado...     Happy Birthday       daisy_drabbles   !     You are way cool and fun.  Am very glad we met.  :D
1	AIM  and  the internet are now working.  It's Friday.  I have a warm chicken pot pie in front of me.  It's payday.  I'm having a good hair day.  I also have one more Smirnoff.  ...   YES! 
1	Just about to leave for Linda's 50th birthday party.  I started drinking about an hour ago but I was sensible and brought low alc beer.  It's surprisingly nice.  I just brought a new bra for the first time in over a year without having a clue which size to get.  My weight has been so up and down in the last 12 months that I don't know from 1 week to the next.  Anyway despite the embarrassment of being in the shop and having to discard nearly every one I looked at for being to big, I ended up just grabbing what I was a year ago (from what i could remember).  Guess what?  I got it exactly right.  I'm very pleased with myself right now.  Still haven't chosen the rest of my outfit yet though so I better go.
1	that was fun.  we finally got to dance near the endish and i got to show off how wonderfully i'm a terrible dancer.  but we had the coolest center piece to our table.  yes, curly tinsle and little umbrellas on the gold styrafoam ball center decoration thing.  and it was nice seeing the annoying sophemores clear all my trash away for me.  now that anjan knows i can drive, i think he finally gets it that i'm a junior.  last night was actually fun too, considering i had to work.  there was good salad and cheesecake and apple pie too.  the jazz band is awesome. really really awesome.  and all guys look nice in tuxes.  still gots lotsa hw...i'll be doing that now, oh joy
0	Still not good enough.  One of these days I will be appreciated.  Not sure who to blame.  Probably myself.  You can't even comprehend what I would give to change something about the past two years.  For now, looks like Dave has the task for being perfect.  Good luck.....he's gonna need it.  Just wish I still had you
1	 Alright so I leave for Disney World in 21.25 hours...but whose counting?    &nbsp;    This is going to kick so much ass. I don't know if I'll be able to sleep tonight becuase I'm so exicted. Tomorrow is going to go by so damn slow!!! Oh well, I'll just have to live with it.    &nbsp;    So had a softball game today. I didn't play and we lost. Whatever. I don't really care anymore.    &nbsp;    My research paper is actually due Tues. which rocks my flipin world. That and I got Mrs. Battle to edit it. Kick ass.    &nbsp;    Other then that I have no life. Really I don't. All I do is play softball, play in band, and drive randomly around with Ben. Damn. I need a life    &nbsp;    ~I float upon a shallow bay, lift me up until the ground gives way

1	Well Im leaving good old Morganton to go to Charleston to marry my mom. I think its going to be a lot of fun. It might be a little rainy because of the Hurricane, but we will get over it. I will let everyone know how it goes and if anything crazy happens.

So many shades of green and blue, flip flop weather all the time! My doggy!!!!! It's too pretty to really explain, just makes me so happy. Even the MCAT studying isn't so bad. :-D
0	    If what I've read from my parchment is true... I simply can't believe the Ministry would do something like this.  At least I don't work in any of the Departments that have to perform this sort of procedure... it's maddening.        Oli, me mate, what say you to a lunch invite this weekend?

1	    What's one of your goals in life?   Hmm… one of my goals in life is to live it to it’s fullest and with someone I love.  As long as it is with someone I care about, truly care about, I don’t care what I’m doing.  Hell, I could be living on the street, dirt poor, and I’d still be happy.  That is all that really matters to me.  So, there is my answer.  Yea!  A question I didn’t mind answering.  Hehe…  Well, things are going well.  I haven’t really been chatting with anyone beyond       hogwarts25   .  Pathetic really, but I enjoy his company.  I need to remember to e-mail Dumbly and tell him my choice for who I will write my essay on… I just hope I don’t screw it up.  My writing skills tend to be atrocious.  *sigh*  Well, I guess I should really try chatting with more people.  But damnit if I don’t want to.  I just don’t seem to have the want to chat with those beyond the few I have.  Oh well.  Heh.  Well, I must send that e-mail to Dumbly.  Ta ta for now.
1	I got the job at Waterworld. I already went and filled out all the stupid paperwork and got my uniforms. This chall be fun!  Well I gotta go...I am going to a movie with Ryan :-D but I have to drive to bfe!  LOVES!!

0	Hi everyone i am looking for  a Bloc Party ticket for Rock city on the 6/10/2005., i was not able to get one before they sold out if anyone can help let me know!  I am thinking about ebay as a last resort  Carter

I  received two notes, sugar smacks, and a christmas card from brittany. what a wonderful girl. she's even trying to teach me how to tie my shoes the good way. i only can do it the bunny ears way!!!! &lt;3. i owe her one.  christmas should be wonderful. i cant wait. vacation will also be GRREEEEEAAAAATTT. just like frosted flakes. i plan to spend tons of time with laura. hopefully if britts not at her dads we can do what we always do on christmas, and after we open all of our presents, we beg our parents if we can hang out, and have a sleep over with all our new stuff. thats what we used to do. im also hoping to spend some time with lace and brittany.

0	"Missing"  Please, please forgive me, But I won't be home again. Maybe someday you'll look up, And, barely conscious, you'll say to no one: "Isn't something missing?"  You won't cry for my absence, I know - You forgot me long ago. Am I that unimportant...? Am I so insignificant...? Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me?  [Chorus:] Even though I'm the sacrifice, You won't try for me, not now. Though I'd die to know you love me, I'm all alone. Isn't someone missing me?  Please, please forgive me, But I won't be home again. I know what you do to yourself, I breathe deep and cry out, "Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me?"  [Chorus]  And if I bleed, I'll bleed, Knowing you don't care. And if I sleep just to dream of you I'll wake without you there, Isn't something missing? Isn't something...  [Chorus]

1	Ok, sorry this doesn't have much to do with ed's , but I just gotta tell you all this! Well, in case you don't already know, I'm the pregnant one struggling to eat healthily because I am ana and mia. Anyhow, I am doing really well!! And, I had my ultrasound on Friday...I'm having a baby GIRL!! I am soooo excited!! I have 3 brothers, so I can't wait to dress her up and buy her dolls! I pray to God she doesn't end up with an ed like me!! Both her father and I are having the hardest time picking a name, so I wanted to ask you all what your favorite girl names are...if you don't mind, I'd appreciate it! The only one we have so far that we both like is Jayna. Thanks all Tina
1	I've had my first offer:  ABB for Computer Science with a year in North America at the University of East Anglia. Not bad. Holding out for Warwick though. *pokes Warwick*
1	Europe's biggest fantasy event was last week saturday... And of course, we were there. It was totally great! People in weird clothes all over the place. There even was a slave with a chariot racing around the place looking for ppl who would want to go for a ride in the chariot... All sorts of LARP groups were trying to get ppl to join they're group. Ppl where fighting with LARP weapons. And of course everything looked like you where in the middle-ages. Stands where you could buy all sorts of stuff were all over the place. And not to forget: Andy Serkins and Craig Parker were handing out autographs!!! Totally cool! Craig Parker's autograph is now hanging on my wall... Well, my day was totally cool... so I have nothing to add...
0	heya... i'm already 6 month in a relationship with my fiancé ^^  i looooooooooooooooooooooove him so much!!!  ...and in summer we'll spend 3 weeks together...  ...*smiles*...  liebe dich...verlobter^^ ...vermisse dich...
1	Just happy, even though I know I failed the entire Psychology exam. Oh, well, there's always next exam. ^___^  Gotta sleep... XD
1	at the moment, i'm all about the frames.  most brilli-ant undiscovered band from ireland ever.  their show at the metro absolutely rocked the socks off everyone there and i didn't want them to ever stop - i was hooked... the atmosphere was warm and electric with the irish majority crowd singing along at every given opportunity...glen looked most impressed... i also experienced absolute silence from the crowd during moments in their slow material which doesn't normally occur at any show from any other band i've been to so far yet...our reading makes our speaking english good awesome songwriting...and a memorable stage presence that left me with a smile on my face when i finally stumbled into bed that night...
1	I was just offered an internship at the National Register of Historic Places, doing digital archive work.  I don't know what to respond (hopefully my program manager does reply to my e-mail asking him how to handle this) since I haven't talked to anyone else yet.    So, one offer, and one interview over the phone tomorrow...both places sound good.  That was awesome news to hear, pumped me up for the workout I'm leaving for. Now.

0	I'm just so sad now.  The reality of what happened is starting to catch up with me and sink in.  I wish this break would be over. :-(  My dream is to just have him end it in a dramatic way and says he loves me so much and can't live with out me.  In a soap opera it would happen like that/ :'(
0	i had a bad day yesterday. and i'm having a semi-bad day today... oh well.  i really don't feel very good. i decided i need everthing under my hips amputated because my ankle hurts and is swollen again, i popped my knee out of joint in gym today and my thighs are killing me from doing squats yesterday at track.   and i definately suck at everything i do. i'm not even good enough to be considered to be in the FROSH/SOPH  meet this week. i suck at everything i do.  i was at track til like 6:30 yesterday trying to work on discus, but i just wasn't in the mood for it but i kept going and got like one good throw in. out of almost 8 billion. and had a nice heart to heart which coach fisher. and now i'm doing burpees every time i ask him to watch me when i haven't done anything different than before because i need to work on what he told me to do.  fun fun.  my life is so going downhill at the moment.
1	i`m up too early.  yup, i am.   i need to go take a shower. but i`m being lazy at the moment.  my auntie`s not having twins. don`t know why or if she ever was. but we think she`s having a girl. *squels* so excited.  talking to everyone now. yay. no idea how many countless arguements we all had. no more...and if there is more, know we`ll always get past them.  i want money. i owe ppl bday gifts,  and christmas is coming up. st. nicks is first though. and i have to buy stockings for the girls.  getting promoted at work. *laughs* it amuses me because i didn`t ask to be promoted. gotta train to learn how to be a trainer. hah.  raise time. ohh yeah.  ummmmmmm still don`t have time to note ya`ll, sorry hunnis. gotta go take a shower now and stop lazying around.  getting starbucks soon. mmmm! starbuck fun. :D  have a nice thxgiving everyone!! && eat too much. =)
0	I've been meaning to update more regularly, but I suck.  So, in a desperate attempt to compensate, you get the short version.  Featuring bullet points.  * Went to San Antonio, got laid, ate lots of good food, generally had fun. * Pictures from Texas are forthcoming. * Vacation was much too quick, featuring 2 days of tourism with fiance and future father-in-law and 2 days of travel. * Got back, discovered I am taking on some more responsiblity at work. * Asked boss for a raise, didn't get it. * Taking a 3-day weekend because I can. * I need retail therapy, but it probably isn't a good idea. * My apartment is a pit, so 3-day weekend will be spent cleaning. * I miss       nottagoth   . * I have chocolate cake and it is very good. * I need a drink.

0	I can’t stand it when people ware fur! Like the human race doesn’t have enough materials to use! A lot of animals that this really sad thing happens too get skinned alive and there are still signs of movement 5min’s after. Its SICK why would anyone want to wear boots with 10 bunny tails dangling from them? Or a fox around their neck that bites it own tail. Leather is a different story, cause you actually eat the animal too that is really a cow’s purpose, the only other thing it would be good for is a lawnmower. If you had space in your yard of course, or even grass. I just don’t think that wild animals should be killed for people selfish crap, distasteful fashion.
1	I have triumphed over my computer! I have not lost my Inbox, after all!  Today... my computer! Tomorrow, THE WORLD!!!
1	Another extraordinarly exquisite Saturday night spent in Scranton. Ashley Paxson's birthday party was quite amazing and I even met some more new people. It's been soooo long since I've met new people my age on a regular basis. Also, Matt Joseph is awesome...  Pictures can be seen  here   Just got back from a birthday dinner for Joe with his family. I think I enjoyed it more than he did. But that's how such things go, i guess.   Happy Birthday Joe!
1	So I'm watching She's All That. What a good movie. And let me say, Paul Walker is definitly eye candy in this one.  Well, gotta go meet Emmy for lunch.
0	He's just a goldfish. Why am I so depressed? I have had him for 5 years. I got him when I still lived with Lisa he was our fish really...kinda like when we left it felt like we got divorced...well now our only son has died and I don't want to deal with it.   I told myself when I got him that it's just a goldfish and I wouldn't cry when he died. I had other fish that I just flushed but he's come to mean so much to me that here I sit with this lump in my throat crying because I don't know what I'm gonna do.   I think I'm going back to bed.  Lisa I'm sorry you had to find out this way. I love you and I miss you.
0	So just when I think things are attempting to be fixed, I hear more shit from completely different people. Its one thing to be angry, but its another to go talking behind their back and then lie about being able to bring issues to ur face.   Uh! I wanna go home! I feel like I cant have people over and I dont belong here and its really frustrating. This is so stupid! Why cant people just tell me what they think of me instead of pretending!   On top of it Im sick with strep and a sinus infection and spots on me that require special lotion that is nasty and instead of trying to feel better I get to deal with shit and try to figure out who my real friends are!   This is ridiculous!
1	as you can tell by the time stamp i am up way too late right now especially as i have work in the morning i swear im going to bed  i just want to say that i had fun with alex i think things went really well another 15 hour day tomorrow  im liking the mondavi crew more and more the more i work and today i was yelling down at bryan webber and pete and mike and the orchestra were really confused as to where it was coming from (i was way the hell up in the curtain lofts) mike was like "dont do it katie, you have so much to live for" im really happy that he and i are still friends  and that things went well with alex:D hheheheh

1	Dude, I'm so incredibly hyper right now it's not even funny. I bought the most adorable shoes for the concert, and I'm going to look so cute! At least I hope. I've been off the wall ever since that Carmel Macchiato at Starbucks. ^#*!(_^*#)!*($!(_)!!!!! I called the mix and talked to Ryan ONeal for like half an hour, he kept telling me to hold on while he went on the air, and it was weird hearing him through the radio and on the phone. ANYWHORE! SARA! KEVIN WANTED SOME ASS FROM ME LAST NIGHT!! REEEEE! Lmao that was scary, ok im over it.  I don't know what else to say I just cannot WAIT FOR THE CONCERT! Lance baby HERE I COME! WOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Okay I'm done. I DONT WORK WITH THE MALES CUZ I USED TO BE ONE. Oh yeah yesterday at Beckys party I beat some ass at basketball and I threw myself in the pool. It was so great. I'm so random. I love it! AND I LOVE YOU ALL!
1	I have been promised that I will be treated like a queen on Saturday night.  Can't wait!!!!!!  (For clarification, the 3 girls that I will be babysitting Sat. nite have insisted that we play with all their new dresses.  Now if I could only teach them role playing games!)
1	Well Keir and I just got home. We went to pick up my best friend...BRIT from the airport and then back to her house for a family party. She looks amazing. She just came back from the campus in rome where I will be soon enough!! YEAH GINA! LOL and she was just in the greek islands for a few days... i have never seen anyone more tan in may...lol   This weekend was long and relazing. I think i read 3 books.. I'm a dork I know. I'm in the burgh till friday though ...with nothing to do...so if anyone wants to hang out let me know...remember i won't be here next semester (cough cough Ben, and Hayley and anyone else I am forgetting) so feel free to call me!  Thats about it for now.. Off to go seduce my boyfriend...
1	So here I am.... I know I haven't said anything about this here but for anyone that doesn't already know here goes. I'm on the east coast right now on the first leg of what could be the coolest experience ever. Lindsay and I are driving from New York to San Diego, making stops in Baltimore, Lexington, Nashville, St. Louis, Omaha, Weiser (Idaho), Seattle, Olympia and San Francisco. So here I am in New York. I just had hot dogs and juice and I'm going to see Kill Bill in about fifteen minutes. When I get back to SD I have Coachella to look forward to, and then I'm getting a new job and an apartment (also with Lindsay) and starting school in June. Life could not be better right now. I'm so glad that I'm not in bored, dreamless nowhereland anymore. I guess the most important thing is that I'm genuinely just really happy to be alive right now. Haven't felt that in a while. Wow... this is a really cheesy entry and I'm ending it right here.

1	I can wear dresses again.  It makes getting dressed in the morning so much easier.  Of course, that means I have to shave my legs more often, but it's a small price to pay.

1	Brendan has just finished uploading images from the Dress Rehearsal of the opening ceremony and also some of the shots from when we were putting out the Audience Kits for the opening ceremony check out  Brendan's web site  and follow the links to the olympic photos - or just click on the photo link above.  Still very proud to be Aussie - as someone worked out last night for The Dream since we have about the same medals as the yanks but we have 1/13 of the population we must be 13 times better - but we knew that anyway.  It is a great feeling to be a part of the greatest show on earth.  Warm and a bit humid today although once you get out of the sun and have a cool drink you can cool off quickly.  Off hiking tomorow and Saturday - hope it cools down a bit more though.  See you Sunday.
1	Who knew that eating whipped topping with hella lot of cocoa powder can taste like an orgasm? Goddayumn it is yummy. and Quiznos. They own. Too bad those ugly, but adorable, rat thingers arent there anymore. They placed the T back in Toasty &lt;3.  Lovely time with Jer, as always.  It cant get any sweeter than this.  This week, so far, as been great.  Im happy. Hes happy. We're happy.  :)  Lovelove.
0	                   Darrel "dimebag" Abbott was killed last night on stage in ohio, i cant even find the words to describe this great tragety but i will try....  even though i only met him once in my life he and pantera were a great influence on me, i credit them for getting me into metal and basically shaping who i am today. I remember getting my first copy of cowboys from hell and thinking wow i hope to one day play like that. the metal world has lost one of its greatest chidren, his grinding riffs will forever echo in the hearts and souls of metal fans worldwide.I hope you are in a better place now,beer in one hand guitar in the other ready to rock where ever you are, you are gone but will never be forgotten, you will live on in the music you made.you were taken from us far to soon, see you on the other side.we love you.

0	i have never been so unprepared for an ap us test in my life. oh gosh, i just am so tired, and i had so much other studying to do.  also, i'm wasting precious time by updating. i'm a total idiot. oh what an idiot i am.....oh well, we all already knew that.   ah i'm so tired, and all i want to do is cuddle up in my bed and watch garden state. ah that must be what heaven is. too bad i'm headed slightly below heaven. damn. i really want to watch that movie.  mmmmm....   now i'm all depressed. damn me!! MUST....GET....BACK.....TO.......Work... ...!!!   ok all done. bye bye   alybob
1	so, today i did a lot of extracurricular work.  i drafted a constitution for a new club on campus - the STD club (standard transmission driver club you dirty dirty boys and girls) and i basically got a new job at the school paper's office.  i am now the Thresher classified ads manager!  it pays $50 a week, with usually no more than 5 hours per week of work (at least that's what my friend/boss polly says).  so now i got plenty of spending money, a nice title, and i can put ads in for free as long as they're not weird or something.  so let's see, i started a club, got 10 members for it and a sponsor, wrote the constitution, and got hired for a new job with a nice title.  i'm a manager and a founder/president.  not too bad for a day's work on sunday... now if only the colts will win this weekend.  and the rice owls of course, along with the boston red sox...
1	Here is another one from the  red  satin shoot. Very, very sexy - almost to sexy to post.  Makes my mind wander.     I could look at this photo non-stop for hours.
0	Oh, I had such ambitions today! I was going to run two miles away from home, then run back. I had four miles planned. I got them done, just not all in a run.  I ran the first two miles. It took me longer than I would have liked - and I won't admit how long that is. Suffice to say, I got them done. I was in a bit of discomfort by the end. My heartbeat felt...funny. During my actual run, it felt like there were tiny hummingbirds beating their wings within my chest. I finished my two miles, and kind of felt like I was drowning. I figured that was a good enough excuse to walk back.  I had a headache after I brought kitty home from the vet. (I think I forced myself to stave that off until I got that important errand done). It's since dissipated with the medication of six chocolate chip cookies, 8 ounces of soy milk, and a berry-banana smoothie.
1	Ignore the random quote. xD Been watching too much Teen Titans lately.  Progress on getting my computer to play World of Warcraft: Best Buy is having a sale on Radion 9550 video cards that works with my computer. My dad and I are going there tonight to get it. *bounces* Then all I'll need is my computer connected to the internet. My dad is thinking about getting high-speed internet through our cable company. Eeee! I hope so!

1	He wipes his hands on anything in reach. He never feels clean. He shakes at night because his nerve is gone, every muscle hurts. Come one come all and see what happened, that broken man is me. There it goes again, I can hear it louder. It dosnt feel good anymore. All I want to know is why does any of it matter? I cant take it anymore, but youve got to try to mke the inhale that makes the exhale so uch better. Now I know I disappear. I cant find my way out from here, everythig is fading on me. Someone tell me why does any of it matter?  Peel back the layers and see what I've become, satisfied? because now I feel nothing. Stay away, I swear it wasnt me.
1	i had an awesome ass weekend!!.. chilled with carly and eli the whole time.. had sooo much fucken fun with them...  me and carly left till the beach around 7 tonight.. it was so random... but so awesome... and i just got back from it.. but it was beautiful.. there was a full moon. and we were swimming in the ocean..ah i wish i could do that every sunday night..    i think im falling for it....

1	This is the movie critic that MOST of the time I COMPLETELY agree with. Until last night.  Keeper and I went to see  Sahara . Now, I LOVE Clive Cussler. I adore Dirk Pitt. I had a huge crush on Al Giordino. Gary panned this movie, and I had very LOW expectations.   Gary Cogill was WRONG!!!   It wasn't a bad action movie. Matthew McConeghy (whatever) actually DID do a good Dirk Pitt - they took the time to give him the right coloring. The guy who plays Al - not the right physical stuff, but the right personality. And William H. Macy as Admiral Sandecker - PERFECT!!!!!!!  About to be late for work.
0	We've enjoyed 3 days of Spring this week!  Today and the previous 2 days have been great!!  The highs have been in the upper 60's and low 70's.  Too bad it isn't going to last.  It's supposed to rain tonight with a low of 44.  That low will also be tomorrow's high as the temp is gonna drop throughout the day.  And that rain?  Tomorrow night it's supposed to turn into a rain/snow mix then just snow.  We could have an inch come Sunday morning.  Oh well, Spring was nice while it lasted.
1	I finally got ahold of Marty. You'd think he lives in some alternate universe the way it seems so impossible to contact him. Granted, I've been rather busy lately myself and haven't had much time to do anything else either, so I can completely understand. It's good to get in touch though. We've made plans to go out for dinner tonight. Maybe see a movie. Definitely catch up because we haven't  really  talked in a while. It'll be a lot of fun, I'm sure. Marty always makes sure of that.
1	This weekend was good. I watched the Superbowl on Sunday. My baby won. Tom Brady, of course! After that we went to Dustins. It was kinda awkward at first but then it started to feel like it used to. The situation between us is weird. I miss his friendship more then anything we had. But I am glad we have that much back. Monday I didn't do anything but go to physical therapy. I get to start practicing on Friday! Im so happy about that. We have a tournament on Saturday. I hope he lets me play. This week was the same as usual. Minus one thing...but it's getting better. Im extremely tired today because I could not sleep last night. My back was hurting really bad. I get a new bed! Im so excited! My current bed is horrible! Valentines Day is on Monday. I don't get to go eat with my family because of softball so my mom is giving me $20 to go eat with my friends, since Im a loser and don't have a Valentines. Oh well...
0	:'-( That is all. I'll die when Dylan leaves. 10 days together and in a little while we'll be apart. I dont think I can take being apart now. I'll just stay in my room depressed. :'-(
1	omg... it's actually snowing.  in farmville.  i am so frickin happy right now!  sure, i have no idea where susan and lexy went off to and i dunno when daddy's going to get home seeing as how he didn't get home until 7:30 last night so i don't know when to cook dinner... but i'm still happy.  maybe we won't have school tomorrow.  i so totally vote for that.  plus, i need to do some sociology.  again.  i really want to get someone to look over my second assignment because i  really need to nail it (research methods, correlations, independent and dependent variables).  i know that i have the second part nailed, but i really do need help on the first part.  shame that pitt doesn't offer a nice lil tutoring center...  if it's still frozen over on thursday, i'll have to see if i can get momma to drive me to pitt.  i don't like driving those roads at night to begin with!!!  charles is being such a dork =)  you gotta love him.
0	I have so much homework to do...because I procrastinated, but maybe I just won't do it all...I messed up bad this week. Became too distracted from school work, and now I'm paying for it. Oh well, I never expected this semester to produce good grades...it sucked from the beginning. But Monday, I declare my Art Major...offically (yeah yeah, its about time). But now I don't know if I want to go down the artist's road, I don't know what I want...Art Therapist sounded fun, or interesting...but I don't know...and I don't know if I want to be an Art Teacher either. Being a Social Studies or English Teacher sounds more fulfilling for some reason. Maybe because they actually teach and make a difference in the lives of their students. But then, being a psychologist...an author... *sighs* This still isn't easy. =(  Anyways, time to go...do something productive...I don't think I'll be getting any sleep tonight.

Zerg, of course, don't traditionally get cloaked units.  The purple colour looks a lot more effective on the Overlord than it does on my Carriers, in my mind.

0	Does anyone know if being really tired and drinking Pepsi could cause depression? Since I got home from an awesome night with the furs, I been feeling kind of...lonely. As if I rather don't belong or if I need to change what I do or say...crazy things pop up. Im blaming me being tired and drinking Pepsi because I hate being depressed...I hope tomorrow morning I will feel better.  Also could be the that I miss Alma a lot... :( *Sighs*
1	   Wow, with yesterday's cold, windy and rainy weather, couldn't tell what to expect today but it turned out to be an awesome day!
1	   Which Colossal Death Robot Are  You ?      Holy Prime Directive, you're Robocop!  Well, you're neither colossal, nor technically a robot, but your arthritic lurching and dubious morals have found their way into the hearts of futuristic rebels and children everywhere. You walk through fire, catch bullets from the air, and you never, ever smile. Combine this with an abstract, almost random concept of duty and honour, and you have a police officer one cannot fail to adore.   Thank you, Robocop. 
1	I'm so incredibly happy! Ever since the other day, I've just been happy with the 1st decision I made in 2005! Okay well it was more like the last hours of 2004 but my resolution to keep it through 2005 and forever on!  I just can't wait for the fun times to come! ......I'm not sure what else I was thinking about writing! &lt;3 Bec
1	wow....   So this has been a GOOD birthday...

1	I love the different shades of green that begin to appear in the spring.  Each tree has its own shade of green, and then all the flowers in bloom add their own touch of spring color.  My neighbor has the most gorgeous tulips in her backyard...maybe I'll photograph them at some point.  Yesterday, my mom and I picked out some petunias for her hanging baskets...some a delicate shade of pink and the other a dark pinkish purple.  I love color.   haha...and then of course all this talk about color and i post a photo without a ton of color...  :-)      
1	Yay, it's 2004. I'm not sure it matters, but last January I had dubbed 2003 to be the "year from he**" Here's hoping 2004 will be kinder. (2003 improved as time went on, say, about april 2003...)  One of the companies I work for gave me a nice present, a Zodiac 2, for christmas, although due to shipping delays they didn't get it until the end of the year. It looks great, and the sound is amazing on it.   I bought Interstellar flames for it. It's tolerable, but a little on the low framerate side. Stunt car extreme is also low on the framerates, but faster and with better video quality. They're worthy launch titles, I'm hoping Neverwinter Nights will be better though. Acid solitaire is rather fun, for a solitaire game.   I am also thinking of porting Everett Kaser software's game engine to Zodiac. I would love to have sherlock and Honeycomb Hotel on a portable unit (without buying a bloody PocketPC.)
1	I am in such a good mood right now.  I had my last night school class at Lindsay Thurber yesterday.  I think that social 30 diploma prep class was the most worthwhile class I have ever taken. I don't know how to explain it, but that class has changed my views on social studies.  Maybe the teacher used indoctrination on us all or something to make us like social studies?  lol, indoctrination, I just used a social 30 vocab term in a sentence:) Actually this seriously is weird what has happened to me, why am I looking forward to writing the diploma?  I hate tests, especially diplomas and I didn't think that I liked social that much either.   Sweetness, day 3 tomorrow, which means double social.  I wish we would write a test or something, I like tests in that class now, especially ones with lots of multiple choice questions on them. I really think I have become brainwashed, but oh wells.
1	ANGELO'S IS OPEN! yes, the best mango water ice on the planet is in my possession now.  I'm going to Maryland with Chuck and Aly tomorrow, should be back sometime Monday night.  that's all.
1	Hey there, peeps! :)   Easter  was great! Had a good time with my dad and family in  Tranås . Visited my grandmother, attended an antique fair, looked for easter-eggs (mine was hidden on the roof of the house) and made a shitload of music with my brother. We ended up with 2 cassettes of demos. :)  The work-week has been kind so far. And I´m loving that  spring  is in the air! It´s like turning a new leaf on the horror that was wintertime this time around. hehe  Today I contacted  OnOff  yet again about not having delivered my stuff. So they promised I´d have it  tonight . Still not here, so we´ll see about that, won´t we, OnOff? Huh?  So what y´all been up to then? I want lengthy reports! :)  I should get a cane. That´d be cool, no? :)
0	blah....todays boring yet again....pso is not keeping me amused...neither is cleaning. right now sis is helping figure out this stuff on here with pics.... thanx sis :) but anyways......RyuuAkuma out.
1	finally done with all my tests and now i'm off to pack to go home today! YAY!
0	My grandmother and aunt Vicki are willing to Kevin and myself tickets so we can go down to Florida.  I like the idea very much, but we can't miss a week from work.  We can barely miss a day.  This is such a bullshit time.  Wish there were real jobs here, but can't convinve certain person about that.
0	I think I've gone a little too far this time.  Wish I could turn back the hands of time.  Torn between two worlds, and two hearts.  What a mess I've made.  What a mess I've become.  God, you are my only hope.  Been sleeping at 4-5 am everyday this week now.  Missed all week of school. Jesus, help me.  You are my only hope.
1	I've just realised that I haven't got enough avatars, so now I got myself some new ones. ;D
0	Yesterday was a rough day and I know that there are going to be many more ahead.  There are so many people confused, angry and hurting.  Last night when in the chapel, I could picture God's face and I know that he was grieving with us.  I could see the tears streaming down his face because he was watching us in pain.   This experience has really woken me up.  We aren't invincible, we don't live forever.  We have to cherish each day, tell others that we love them as much as possible.  I pray that God will bring comfort to the family and friends of Brandon.
1	Welcome to Pchuu Icons! This livejournal is merely to showcase the icons I've made. Since I am poor (and lazy) this journal may never be "beautiful." I figure you're here to see the icons, NOT the journal. So, enjoy!

0	Let's see. Life these days is going kindof rough for me. I can't really handle it all that well. So I've just looked like I've died these past few days. And I'm sure you're wondering why...well that I'm not telling. Basically this is jsut for those select few that have been here for me to talk to about it.   Robin~ Thank you so much for giving me a wake up call...I really needed it and you made sure you got your point across! Thank you for always being here for me! I love you!   Tay~ Thanks for letting me vent to you and for giving me credit for handling this. I love you!  Steve~ Thanks for caring...and giving me your advise. I know you'll give great advice to your sisters in the future.   Chels~ Thanks for your advice and listening to me...    I know that I should just get over this but it's harder than you think. I'm working on it though. Just give me my time and one day I'll be myself again.
1	     Sing along now...

Me and a few of my fictional characters gather to embrace the festive spirit...    Merry Christmas, everyone!   -Rich
1	Well, tomorrow morning I leave for Israel. The next 11 days or so will be full of birthright-y goodness. I will miss you all (esp. Susie :)) and will expect lengthy comments about what you all do for the next one and a half weeks. I will try to remember what I end up doing and will post about it when I get back - I may or may not keep this, we'll see. I will also take lots of pictures and maybe scan them in for y'all. I feel like I'm giving some sort of speech.  So I'm off to pack some more and then leave tomorrow. Bye bye. Chesleva v'se.
1	I know the winterguard/drumine is going to Mills Godwin, right around now, so they're not available - but, THE REST OF YOU are fully expected to show up at school to see ME, I mean, the lovely performers in the  TJ Talent Show!  That's right -  7:30  in the TJ auditorium (tickets are $7, I think).  In case you hadn't heard, my dad and I are performing a clogging routine (the duet we choreographed last summer and performed at Band Camp). It's gonna be really awesome, so ALL OF YOU should come!!  Good luck to SWE at festival, and WG/WDL at Mills Godwin!
0	All it takes is a rant from my mother to throw off the evening...  I guess at this point I'm going to go back to sleep and try to forget.
1	Hate me with everything I'm better off without your animosity I'll even sleep better at night...at night I won't believe in you Reminded me of everything you put me through Now everything feels alright...alright  I feel so betrayed...mistaken I create another day You'll be gone tomorrow Lie to me.. you're faceless  You've made me out to be Responsible for your self-inflicted misery And never felt like this before...before Don't be surprised to see That I have nothing left for you to bleed When you come crawling back for more...for more  I feel so betrayed...mistaken I create another day You'll be gone tomorrow Lie to me...you're faceless     i have a new best friend and his name starts with b
0	...unfortunately. *sadface*  I had a GREAT weekend in Jacksonville. It was great seeing Auntie Myrna and Richard. I spent most of the time indoors because of the weather, but it was great to spend time with Auntie "Cherry". The last time I saw her was when I was 15 years old.   I'm even contemplating transferring to Jacksonville, once she's still there. We'll see how that goes.  Anyway, I'm back in B-O-R-I-N-G Miami.   Ciao
0	...and it is possible that my cousin is one of them.  We don't know anything yet.
0	 THE DEATHROCK COOKOUT IS BEING CANCELLED!!  The weather is just too crappy outside.  And trying to cook (and DJ) in the rain ~as funny as that would be to watch~ isn't such a good idea...  SO  We will reschedule, because response to this idea was overwhelmingly good, and we were all very excited about it. Dammit!!   We'll see you all next week!!!  (or elsewhere tonight)    other events tonight:  Bella Morte @ 9 Lives Anniversary Party @ the Highlander Brit-pop @ MJQ 
0	My grandmother emailed me late last night. My great-great Aunt Edie passed away. She was the youngest of my great-grandmother's siblings and the last of them to go after my great-gran died in '94.  I only met her once, when I was about three, so I knew her mainly in photographs. There was this one - my favorite - taken in 1915. My great-great-great-grandparents were sitting down, with all of their children (12) standing behind them in a semi-circle. Edie was between her parents' chairs. Not a one of them were smiling. I used to stare at that photo for hours as a girl.  God, I don't even know how old she was, only that she had Alzheimer’s. After everything, you would think death wouldn't be new to me. I have buried so many loved ones.  Shit. I'm out.
1	I had some old scanned pictures on my computer, so I decided to share them with LJ.     Enjoy!   I love all of these pictures.

1	So the first day of classes was encredibly simple for me. The first class at 10 was cancelled and the second class was more of a review.  So it was pretty awesome. I should probably now go into town and buy some stuff, then work on other stuff I should have completed before break. It feels good to finally have freetime!! (I seemed to be working or sleeping most of the time over break)
1	YAY!! Luke and I are getting ready to go back to Oregon.   He thinks we are leaving tomorrow morning at 6, but I don't think we'll make it by then.  I'm super excited because I want to see my family.  We are going to stop in Medford for a bit and then make it back up to the coast.  It will be nice to see the ocean again.  I dyed my hair last night (Finally) and I am going to get it cut while I'm in Medford.  I'm really excited about that.  Its been too long and its starting to bother me.  I haven't had a cut since August.  Anyway, Lukey is painting our tables and I want to cook dinner so I'm gonna go.  I'll post later on.  :)
0	We've been giving Lucy  Medised  to ease the poor bairn's suffering.  According to the bottle, we mustn't allow her to drive or operate heavy machinery and she should avoid alcohol.  That buggers up her plans for the weekend then......
1	      sinboy    and I are moving to New York, and will be having a garage sale on Saturday to get rid of all the stuff we don't want to take with us. We have tons of clothes and books (lots of mystery, science fiction, and nonfiction), school supplies, art supplies, computer parts, a desk, a space heater,  and who knows what-all else. Please come check it out on Saturday--or on Sunday, because anything we didn't sell is going to hang out in front of our garage until someone takes it away!  We're on Alemany at Lyell (not far from the Glen Park BART station). Stop by anytime between 10 and 5 on Saturday, or anytime at all on Sunday to pick through the remains.

1	Worked again last night and I work again 2nite.  Jobs been going well.  People are cool.  Everyone's happy.  Even me :)  I survived my first week of work, although I spent more this past week then I would have liked too.  Everyone's been telling me I seem so much happier now that I am working.  I bought myself some aviator shades today too, I'm hot.  This coming week I will hopefully be able to make some more dough and actually kick some back this time.
1	I hope that everyone has had a wonderful Christmas!  I know that I certainly have.  I've had a great time back home visiting with mom & dad and got to play Pictionary with my cousins last night.  Good times had by all.  I'm sure I'll do more of a recap later, but I've got more pressing things to write about while mom & dad are out tending to the animals.  So, Merry Christmas and I'll catch up on details later!

My classes are easy and fun, i have no reason to be sad or angry and, it is FRIDAY!  I also just got some stuff from Kettering university.  That is a really good engineering college.  It wasnt any of that pre-typed, all seniors get one type of letter either.  It was hand written, so that has to mean something.  I also am going to go and stay over night in november, so that'll be super cool. haha  Tomorrow, i am going to go to a wedding with Katie Paluch, and that will be a fun i would think.  Plus I like to hang out with her.  Well, i am off to eat and possibly sleep.

1	The lovingcaring sister made me a really cool costume for the CON and it's so cool, espessialy the claws on the shoulder pads. Being the smart and creative sister that she is she used chili peppers and painted them silver, and they look really cool. Sister so good to me, well except whEAN I'M TRYING TO SHOWER.

But the best part is I get to be with DREW. I cant wait. It seems like it has been forever making these plans and being able to reach them but finally I think its actually going to come true. I am truly afraid of flying but im soo excited that i dont think thats really going to be a problem. Now the thing is what the hell do i pack . LOL.. anyways i cant wait.. I hope that i can land a job so that i can have extra money to go there with. Drew has big plans and wants to make it prefect but what he dont get is that as long as im there it will be prefect..

0	2 down, 3 to go. tonight's show went well also. but i had kind of a crappy day. i'm failing gym, and i'm really pissed off because thats like the only class i need to graduate. i didn't even cut the class! it's just annoying...like i'll probably get the grade changed but i didn't even want yoga in the first place.  i had fun at the mall though, it was beautiful out and we were being such girls with the wind blowing in our hair and throwing poppers out the windows at people (some unsuccessful). it was nice to hang out with liz and kris and ariel. pleasant.  i thought i was gonna see a bunch of people tonight, but i didn't. then i was in a funny mood, and i still am.
0	 and though you'll grow away no matter how you change, I'll know you. And when you tire of life alone, there will always be one sure way back home...  You just turn on the quiet, and you close your eyes and listen inside. 
0	Today I came to the realization some people will never grow up. they just want to stay in that teenage way of life forever, they do not care about the promises they make to other people or children. To me that is one of the worst things you can do, he just does not care or have any reguard for other people. when I first meet him I though he was the sweetest person now I think he is a slacker and a loser. No matter what we do we can not get him to see that he is headed for self distruction and jail but he just does not see or want to hear it. well enough about him my husband is wonderful and i could not ask for a better roommate then the one I have.  My life is great I just worry about him "the friend".  anad about this new promo. I am tring to  get I feel it will better my life both in my family life and career.  I will be able to see my husband more then once a week and I can startputting my plans in to action with my health and social life. well that all folks

1	 Okay, I know it's wrong that I'm happy that my dad's in Daytona for a week, but...I am soo glad to have the computer all to myself for a week! I really, really am.     And I must share that the Sarah Jessica Parker Gap Ads are the best thing since ever. No joke.     Oh yeah, my friends suck because no one wants to go see Bob Dylan w/ me. I mean, he's going to be in Michigan in April, and I totally want to go but no one wants to come with. People are of the suck.    And also... HAPPY 3 MONTHS UNTIL COMMON ROTATION!!! WHEE!!!

0	Duo#2 left today. At the moment I am not feeling so great. Never fully or even partially pour your heart(or how ya feel) out to anyone, unless you understand the current situation to the fullest. I had to re-learn that lesson again, the hard way. Then again, don't rush things. The second best advice that I will give people is: "Don't rush things." I want to be with someone. I really do. I hate being lonely. Anyways, someone made me realize somethin' today. Actually, three very nice people made me realize something today and last night.    I really don't know what to think anymore, about this subject. I am speechless......... I am not thinking about anything at all..... My mind is blank.    -Tetsuo

0	I called out sick at work yesterday.  Where I work, you have to call and leave a message on an answering machine, so I did.  Then shut my ringer off and went back to bed.  I just checked my messages and have a message from my boss around 12:30 asking where I am and hoping everything is ok since I was scheduled 9-6.  Crap.   I DID leave a message, but how can I prove it if someone listened to the message and didn't tell the appropriate department?  I hope I'm not in trouble. I kinda wanna cry. And woohoo! reviews are coming up and I now have an unaccounted for absence under my belt. yay for me.  I just can't seem to win.
0	Sup, it's been a while, we'll just say, whiplash, hyper-extended elbow, glass in my hands, stitches, and hip dislocation.  Do you wanna know why.  A rabbit. www.snapsnet.8m.com/mycar.jpg 4 weeks this coming tuesday.
0	I made a terrible mistake today.  I was caught behind someone going 20mph in a 35 zone.  Err...it got me so mad, so the first chance I got to pass (dotted yellow line), I took it!  Passing in anger is not a good idea.  There was a cop sitting just up ahead that saw me passing and I was promptly pulled over for speeding.  That was so dumb of me to do that.  I'll be paying for this one.  Looks like I have to learn the hard way.  Hopefully the judge will have some kind of pity on me. :\  This has been the worst 3 months of my entire life.  I just want to find something to be happy about again!  Why is that so hard!?
1	charity at this second is driving back to San Jose!   i didnt think she would be coming back down here so quickly

1	ah quien lea este journal...Feliz dia del amor y la amistad !!!
0	I'm all teary and sad and I don't know why. Just things, I guess. Let someone down, and myself, and just been putting too much stress on myself recently. But it's all been worth it, I don't regret it. So much to do though.  And... and I don't know what. There's someone I want to continue to endear myself to, but if I try I just feel that I'm imposing myself upon them, that they deserve better. Just pretty pissed with myself in general, and with life.
0	Removed  When the word "removed" is used to describe a relationship, it indicates that the two people are from different generations. You and your first cousins are in the same generation (two generations younger than your grandparents), so the word "removed" is not used to describe your relationship.  The words "once removed" mean that there is a difference of one generation. For example, your mother's first cousin is your first cousin, once removed. This is because your mother's first cousin is one generation younger than your grandparents and you are two generations younger than your grandparents. This one-generation difference equals "once removed."  Twice removed means that there is a two-generation difference. You are two generations younger than a first cousin of your grandmother, so you and your grandmother's first cousin are first cousins, twice removed.  Ah ha! I have undiscovered the greatest mystery. How 'bout them apples?
0	So there was this guy that was kinda interested in me.  We hit it off really good and we were getting kinda close...  Then he told me I had to choose between him and my boys, so guess who I chose.  Now Chris, James,Alex and D are out there possibally beatin him up.   I need a hug...and a drink...and an actually life.
1	I got enough sleep last night, for one thing, and apart from my eye bothering me a little, I'm MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better today than I've been in ages.  Sleep is good.  Hugs to all.  David
0	I got all dressed up this morning because it was my birthday and I felt like it. And then I changed into blue jeans because my dress pants were killing me. Too fat. But really it's not that I'm too fat, it's just that the suit I was trying to squeeze into was one that I'd had forever. I wanted to wear it because it was my favorite, but really it doens't fit anymore. Oh well. Blue jeans it is. I washed a dress to wear today but it came out of the dryer all twisted up and linty. So that didn't work either.  I also woke up really really cold and really really stuffed up. Not much of a birthday I guess, I feel like shit. My honey and my friend and I were going to go swimming, but I don't think I'm up to it now.
1	We're getting our own radio show!  *bounces*  ... I need a new "Nowak's army" icon.  Since EARNIE STEWART (guy in the middle in the icon) LEFT US.  *grumbles*  I also need to find my film with the from the MLS Cup championship celebration.  At which I got sandwiched between Ryan Nelsen and Alecko Eskandarian (entirely not my fault, just a wonderful wonderful accident), got a hug from Dema Kovalenko (any day with a hug from a footballer who looks like Viggo Mortensen is a good day, says I), and got a kiss on the cheek from Jaime Moreno.  ... sorry, where was I?  Oh yes.  Radio show!  Squee!  And!  Season opener is a week from Saturday!  Bweeeeee!  *twirls*
1	aron & i just booked our spring vacation. yay, vacations! we're staying in paris for 7 nights, lille france for 1 night, and brussels for 3 nights.  (flying into paris, out of brussels, with train trips between.)  now i really have to kick my french learning into high gear. my french class through arlington community education starts on thursday night.
0	Fuck you god! i fucking hate you! what did i ever fucking do to you? Fuck you! Why dont you just kill me instead of just trying to fuck me over all of the time. I guess you arent going to do shit untill i spin around and challenge you like patty smith did, and i guess i will fall off the stage and brake my neck. well lets go then. Fuck you! I hate girls too! I dont even know what to say about them. But fuck off. Im so alone.
1	I went bike riding on Sunday. To prepare for the ride, I pulled out an old pair of in-the-ear headphones. I had them lying around for years, but hadn't used them in ages. It was a whim; in-the-ear style 'phones seemed like such a better ideg than my normal over-the-ear style.  When I went to use them, the foam padding disintegrated! I hadn't really looked at them in years and time had ravaged them.  I used them anyway. The idea of a ride without tunes just didn't appeal. That was fine and dandy, except the left channel kept cutting out. The wires were going as well.  I never thought of something like headphones as being subject to entrophy, but I guess, in the end, everything is.  ?y the way, it was an awesome ride!
1	It's offical, I have my fiancee visa to the UK.  ^_^

I have to get ready for my adventure to New Hampshire to live with my Mom. I'm very excited to get the hell out of Mass and be in a calm enviornment! I can't wait to start writing music and reading and drinking and feeling the crisp New Hampshire air across my face! Woo Hoo!   Time to start a brand new chapter in my life!
0	Yeah, I'm probably going to be pretty depressed for the next few days unless things start looking up, and then this weekend could end up either killing me or driving me so far insane that returning will be impossible
0	People leave our world of Lineage all the time, but it always seems most difficult when they're your friends.    Yesterday, while I was hunting Forgotten Island with my pledgemates Ludi and NewbieRoy, an old friend whispered me.  He's Korean and his english isn't great, but I understand him.  Back to what he said.  Friend: "T you. T_T" Friend: Bye. T you again.  He hadn't been playing much at all, and considering that he used to play a ton of hours, I thought it was strange.  So I assume this means that he is leaving game.  I tried to ask him what he meant, but he didn't say anything.  I guess he was busy...  He was one of the first people I met (besides Valkyr).  I remember how he use to be lower lvl then me, then suddenly he was about 7 lvls above me.  If he did indeed leave... I'll be sad that I didn't get to properly say goodbye.  I hope he hasn't left.
1	I had an awesome night last night  you girls are the coolest!  I found a letter in and apparently I got into TDP so yay!  I'm excited everyone is like cool what do you do in tdp and my only response is I don't know haha.  Well I'm off to have a great day of rollarblading with Jacki give us a call if you would like to join us, or have something better to do haha.  Bye!

0	I just had a really strange but good dream about drinking beer. Which led to drinking beer mixed with hot chocolate. Which led to drinking beer milkshakes, which exist, and are good, at Schnack.   I'm seriously in denial.  My life is empty because I do not have three little japanese girls singing with me, or saying "kawaii" or "cho samui" every 30 seconds.  They really did change my life, and I don't care how corny, or melodramatic it sounds. It s true. I just know that there's so much more, and I cannot deal with the monotony that tends to be my life.   As Jane said, we should just go live in JAS mart, or really form Chloe's commune, and go to Japan, and do stuff that will make us happy.  Aight.   mushmushmushmushmushbrianaismushymushmus hmushmush

We're all going to visit Sister #2 of 3 at college; it's her first year!!!  I'm very excited to see her cheer at the homecoming game, and of course to go home and pat the horses and drag some of my stuff back to the apartment.  It will be fabulous!  ^_^  Wish me luck on the drive through NYC, and I hope everyone else's weekend will be as cheery as mine!
1	Well I finally found out who was playing at the 98.7 party like two rappers Mc lite.. And some other old rapper. Thats sad. Man their gonna get on stage and like have someone to carry their oxygen tanks up their behind them. I remember when I was like five my mom use to listen to that shit.. I did however get my ticket to Pantera 2 day.. Travis came to my house at like 9:00 and woke me up=\ I had to pay for Alan's too. But he said he would pay me back. So he will. Now we have a car full. Hopefully we can like stay somewhere cauz if Travis gets sleepy he'll wreck and kill us all. He said he would talk to his mom and I guess I should take to mine too. I'm sSsSoOo HAPPY! We got on the floor. So that'll be good=) It starts at like 6 so we'll have to leave at like 4 or so.. We all wanna get there early, so we can meet up with ppl we know.. I'm glad Alan and Erica are going this is gonna be fun! Well I guess that's all for now.
1	24 hours from now, I'll be finally on my way home after four months! I haven't seen my dog in ages and frankly I miss my mom's food (and her of course). Unfortunately I have to study the entire Easter holiday...   In other news, I just finished "The Beekeeper's Apprentice" and "A Monstrous Regiment of Women". I have to admit they're good, not the "real" stuff, but still very entertaining. I also saw "Constantine" which wasn't actually that bad, just a bit.. lacking...  Well, I just have to survive the endocrinology exam tomorrow, and I'm off to the Easter holiday! YAY!!!  ps. Still cleverest.

1	        So I finally got arround to posting pics of my new bike. This is my new 1999 ZX9R. It's my second bike. My first one was a 1985 ZX900. Had it for about 3 years then I found the new one on sale for $3,500 I could not pass it up. But wow what a huge difference. The guy I got it from was 42 years old, hardly ever red lined it, never even pulled a wheelie, all dealer serviced. I put the new LED turn signals on. Plus the front and tail I made blue LED clusters. I'll get some pics of that soon :) So really just thought I'd share.

0	Today was too hard. The weather seems to be reflective every time i go to a funeral. Krista...car crash, bubbly, happy, would have wanted to say goodbye...bright sunny day. Matt...suicide, i don't need to say more...dark and stormy. Fitting weather in each case.  I don't want to have to go to one of those anytime soon.  Tim...tell me what song you played.  Rest in Peace man...hope it's better there.
0	Well, I was just chatting with some of my friends and I realized something...I'm a loser.  Nobody wants me.  There is not a freaking person in this world who wants me.  All my friends are getting laid, having fun, they get calls...NOT ME!!!  But why would they?  My own father didn't want me, why would anybody else?

That would probably be a funnel cloud that just happened to touch down.  I really doubt it'd be called a Tornado.  I mean, I don't even think a trailer home was damaged.  That's saying a lot!  Funnel Cloud in the itty-bitty city I live in!  WHee!  It's just like being back in Indiana!  Yay! :)  Damn, I really miss having actual weather!  Best thing of all?  Knowing this crappy weather fucked up the  Masters!   Double Yay!  I'm off to find something to do with my bachelorette status....

Everyones getting older... im just now starting to realize it... kinda sad actually. but we all gotta grow up sometime.  I gotta cut my hair a little soon for the play... but it will grow back... haha  GOOD NIGHT EVERYONE~!

0	To think I was complaining about my transmission leaking the other day, now I wish that was my only problem...I got in a car wreck today, there were like four cars in front of me that just stopped really quickly, and now the front end of my car is completely torn up. It's fixable, but will probably cost more than my car is worth to get it fixed. *sigh* At least I'm okay, though.    Alias  better be really good tonight. I need some good escapist TV.

0	I was hoping this was some sort of sick april fools joke, but no.  Mitch Hedberg is dead.  For those of you who this means nothing to, I pity thee. We've lost a great comedian who was only just starting to get the fame and attention he deserved.  That's what you get when you dabble with drugs kiddies. (that part is unconfirmed, although very likely.)  le sigh   http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/149935 2/20050331/hedberg_mitch.jhtml?headlines=t rue    http://www.nbc13.com/entertainment/4335 236/detail.html    http://www.defamer.com/hollywood/go ssip/mitch-hedberg-is-dead-037763.php 
1	So today was a great day. Darik told me that we were playing on thursday, sort of exciting.  I miss the old show when they used to be almost every week. That was fun. I met so many cool people. Well I think things will go back to that this summer, then I will go away for college. Sad/Exciting.        I saw courtney at wal-mart and she caught me buying a band to put the beads on for the bracelet im making her. In a way it was very convenient that she was there, I could measure her wrist.     Some days I can just write and write and write some more, but others nothing comes to me. I sometimes can fit lyrics to what I'm playing, or it sound to boring and basic. What ever, I'm sure it will come to me.       I can't wait for school to end, because then...then I truly know that this is my life. I know that its me and I make the decisions. Its weird. That was a compliment.
1	So I have arrived in Toronto safe and sound. Found my way from the Airport Terminal 3 to the TTC to the Subway to Bloor/Ossington. Walking along Bloor wondering if I would ever get to Nick's place, and not knowing where that place actually was, an old hippy man carrying stocks of some sort looked me in the eyes and stated "Beautiful". I am now petrified of Bloor. Nick's on his way home from work early now and I am cooking a pizza I just bought so off I go.  Until tomorrow...                        Joce
1	CURIOSA Saturday!!! I am so psyched.    That's all I have to say. [Goodnight]
1	Yes, this girl reads online comics, and lots of 'em.  I have two more to recommend for your reading pleasure.  But this time, it's not my fault.      The first comic,  Two Lumps , I blame on       tiirz   , who sent me a sample strip or two.   Two Lumps  is another Kewt Kitty Komic, to which I apparently have no natural immunity whatsoever.  The strip follows the adventures of two Russian blues, the intelligent and grouchy Ebeneezer, and the rotund and dim-witted Snooch.    The second I blame wholly on       littlecrow   , who linked to the strip on her site.   The Devil's Panties  is a high-spirited romp of a strip, following the main character, an artist/gaming intern, as she faces graduation, jerky guys, gaming conventions, the Spuffy, and chats with Jesus.  The strip's art reminds me a little of Berke Breathed but even more of Los Bros. Hernandez of  Love and Rockets.   (The women have normal thighs!)  Go, start at the first strip.  You will have fun.
0	Being a responsible adult sucks.  There are parties and things happening tonight. But I work from from 1 to 10 PM. Yes, I could go to these parties at ten. I could go to movies at ten. But I'm so tired and ready to sleep once I get off work. I just want to toddle home and go to bed.  I'm sad about that. And even more depressing is the fact that all this money I'm making won't be going to fun activities or new clothes or new books or coffee. It's all going to rent, utilities, and food. I hardly get to play with any of it.  I guess I should feel good about being a respsonsible adult and being mostly self-reliant.
0	  Thanks to       mandichan    for finding a name for our couple of friends! Also big thanks to anyone who suggested something. It was very hard to pick winners.  Unfortunately, they are both fighting over the name "Fluffy" and neither is going to give up any ground. So they have been sulking since yesterday. I doubt we will see them for a while...  *Maf!*
1	So, I posted "Rainbow Wings" a few weeks ago in here.  Since, I've entered it in Windows, my school's fine arts magazine and sent it to Nancy, the executive director of QYC, the GLBT youth group I go to, to see if she'd like it in the newsletter that gets sent out periodically. Well, here's an email I got from Carolyn, the site director:  Hi Jamie,   Nancy and I had lunch today and she told me how moved she was by your poem and I asked her to send it to me.  This is so very beautiful and powerful.  I was wondering if I could share it with some of my friends - if that is okay with you (and it's really okay if you are not comfortable with it), how would you like me to address the issue of your being the author?  I could say it's from one of our youth leaders or would you want part of all of your name used?  This is REALLY good... you are obviously very talented.   A very moved Carolyn
0	well, christmas break is over... i go back to dumb school now. i really dont feel like trying anymore... although i did super well this past semester, i just dont feel like applying myself anymore.   i think i'm going to buy a diploma from one of those things on tv... "three easy payments of $19.95 and you get a genuine college diploma!"  my poor carl is sick, and i cant even take care of him!! :( i want to hold you until you feel better baby...   i'm going home now. work is overrated.
1	This week went by like a slug. Very dull and slow, and a times, sticky. RED VS. BLUE!!!!!   THIS IS GOOD SHIT! obviosly i am still bored and unemployed.    sooo... if you ahve anything to say, SAY SOMETHING, NOW!              GET TO THE CHOPPER!!
0	I can't find my ipod or my cell phone.  I'm praying they weren't somehow left at work on friday and stolen.  I went to riding lessons friday night, but other than that, I can't recall leaving the house at all all weekend.  In fact, I don't think I even checked the mail on saturday.  And since the weather was terrible all weekend, I didn't go to church on sunday.  I'm hoping that they are in the car somewhere.  My purse was open and fell over at one point when I was driving; they could have slipped under the seat.  Dennis said he checked, but he checked when it was dark out, and the fuse for the dome light in my car is blown.  This is super sucky.  I miss my music.  And I can't make calls I need to make; can't call long distance at all.  what a sucky time to be PMSing.
0	Sick again at the worst possible time.......  i feel weak... but i also feel disappointed..... oh well now time to move on....   Got my friend addicted to Final Fantasy Tactics..  went through the story again.... god i love it  its homecoming night so no1 is really on... it would  be nice to actually seriously chat with a friend for once blah... my head hurts now.. need sleep... oh... why am i hated?
0	I failed ... why did I even waist my time thinking about passing ...
1	Piotr, can I just say, I love you.  And to the guys who were jamming, you all are really cool!  Though the ... uh ... subtext of competition or whatever was really kinda weird.  Ballet class went well.  Well done to everyone who showed up.  I'm going to practise some of the more difficult stuff, if you want to watch.  I'll be there quite often.  Just kinda show up, I don't mind :D
0	All of me appear to be conducting vastly complicated sex lives. I am getting horrific frustration-by-proxy. It's quite distracting. Although I of course  haven't much choice  have no interest in such things, it is nevertheless troubling. I quite violently wish that the Beige One would have sex with something. Anything. Even the Master. Even Turlough. Maybe. I can repress it later. I just need *this* to stop.  There's an ice box somewhere, I think...
1	i saw a bunch of roosters roaming in a parking lot. i thought i was losing my mind.  green day tomorrow. hell fucking yeah.
1	Didn't like the Indian Chicken stuff.  'cept the rice and bread.  At least I have tried it now.   Got to meet Jenn's hubby today.  He seems nice.  And I think they look cute together. Started painting Alayda's trim last night.  Painting it white so it looks more updated.  It only takes 5 good coats.  -Not even half way done. :(  Hopefully it'll pay off when selling the sucker! Kind of quiet today.  I've forgotten how good Tootsie pops are.
1	Merry Christmas, peeps!  &gt;^.^&lt;  And a Happy New Year, too, just in case I don't get around to posting then.
1	JOSIE AND BONG .......      THE STONE IN HOLLYWOOD                JOSIE AND COOKIE               KAI AND JOSIE               CHAMPOY OF DIE ROCKERS DIE   LAST WEEKEND WAS AWESOME..

1	I got a job finally.  Wokring at Taco Time, yeah it's fast food, but it's money. So Tha'ts what I'll be up to for a while. History note:I worked at a Taco John's when I was in high school hence the 'Taco Bob' nickname. For somereason the nickname lost it's amusement when I actually saw a 'Taco Bob's' on the outskirts of Minneapolis. It sat in a run-down sub-division with a Miller Lite sign in the window that was half burnt-out.  Well at least it's  astart to getting me moved out and on my feet again.
1	an utterly depressing and shitty weekend has just been made 100x better :)  still though, fuck sundays.
1	wow who knew that not going to school would be even MORE boring then actually going? it would be better if others we not in school either.   TODAY I AM GOING TO GET SOME PERCINGS! im excited...a little worried...dont really like painful things but o well.  xo ash
1	  HEY, SO IT WAS ON THE BOARD AND THE DOOR TODAY, BUT  TOMORROW  IS  UPLINK ! PLEASE BE SURE TO COME. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY  COOL  DEAL, SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE....IS THIS A  VIBRANT  MESSAGE OR WHAT? ANYWAY,  7:45  IN THE CHOIR ROOM!!!!!     
1	Stormy is gonna post some cute pictures of us at the park.Enid cried and screamed when we had to leave. It was cute. =)
0	I went to visit Nana and Buddy on Tuesday.  Mommy got a flat tire and Buddy had to change it for us.  Sometime that day, I got bit by something...a mosquito or a spider.  Anyway, the left side of my face is all swolled up now.  Mommy took me to the doctors today and they told her to give me Benadryl, that I am just very allergic to insect bites (I got that from Mommy).  It doesn't bother me but I look awful.  Mommy took these pictures this morning while I was eating bananas, so some of the swollen cheeks is from my breakfast...       We have plans to go to the zoo tomorrow with Lily, Jeffrey adn Miss Julie.  YAY!
1	well i've just been given another offer to move out with one of my best friends! she and i need eachother at the moment and seeing b/w the both of us we have everything we need to move out with it might become a possuibility. julie, my friend from uni who i originally wanted to move out with wants different things to me and she already has a few other people wanting to move in with her.....so maybe i'll take the new offer.  i cannot wait until i move, have my own place. find a new job, become the person i've been waiting to become.
0	Thursday Joe slept over my house and we hung out with jackie friday and my brother hung weith us for a lil while.Thursday me and Joe went to the mall so i could look at stuff to see how is needed b4 i can place an order...lol babe.I am hoping megan gets her computer up and running today i rerally miss her i know she isn't really gone compeatly yet but still...you know.idk o well untill next time
1	Ok, phase two and phase three filed (actually, they were filed about two weeks ago - it took a while for the receipts to come through)..  With the current backlog, the USCIS is processing cases that were filed..  phase 2: 10 months prior to mine phase 3: 11 months prior to mine   UPDATE 1:   Woo! phase 2 just went down to 9 months prior.  UPDATE 2:  More woo! Got an appointment letter to get fingerprinted. I wasnt expecting this for another nine months or so. It is possible that the Phoenix office is even further ahead of the backlog number published for their region, but I think thats too big a guess to make at this stage.
1	I'm up, for some reason, very early on a Sunday morning. And things couldn't be better, for me at least. Although, sadly, my friends woes seem to be going from bad to worse, I find myself in a situation where I have a great new girl, several jobs I'm actually qualified enough to have a chance in hell of getting to apply for and more and my weight is still dropping. In short, things are going well!  This week should be an interesting week. The insurance money will be being paid sometime early on in the week and that means... SHOPPING SPREE! And of course tomorrow, it's Valentines Day, the first in close to two years that I've had which will actually be worth celebrating because I've got someone to celebrate it with. And I'll be sending off a few job applications as well, because money, as evil as it is, is something that I want.  I'll update again tommorrow or Tuesday, probably. Peace out 'till then, people!  - L.B
1	   Hi!     I'm not really into gardening.  I used to say that I was really NOT into gardening.  Then every once in a while I read things like  this  and I think about how gardening could be really great!  Even if I would have to deal with dirt (ok, we can call it  soil , maybe that'll make it better).            I love Brussels Sprouts.  Look at these!                 -(Cheers)       generalist   
1	    He's moving in. How'd it get there so fast? I don't mind though. Far, far from it. I have his house keys, just had them duplicated   and also...the keys to the new car he wants so badly. Because...uh, I have a car and he should have a car and I have no other reason but that  ...am I doing the right thing!? Someone tell me.  Oh and I'm quickly learning that I'm a jealous CRAZY PERSON...when I want to be.    *sniffles* I have the tiniest of colds. I think I got it from that idiot Kiratani from the two to six. Disgusting the way he handles the equipment. Jeez, it's freezing here in the booth. I can't find my office sweater...sure it's here somewhere.   I'm hungry. Oh boy.  Oh, I found this in a pile while cleaning!~         Ah youth. &lt;3  
0	our prayers were not answered, looks like the kids are going to be staying for a little while longer (at least 20 days). They are good kids, it is just that our house has taken to much damage. That and the fact that RA & I are both exhausted, and pissed off at DSS does not make thing easier. We are being guilt tripped by all parties to keep the kids. Of course none of the people guilt tripping us had to clean crap up off the floor when the toilet flooded, or are going to help paint my kitchen ceiling.
0	all i want to do is skate and move out of my house bc i have to live with so much bullshit!
1	i am just so excited about our red soxs.  after a decade and a half of disappointment, they have made me a very happy girl.  year after year, the depression, the heartache, asking why??  why??  why can't it be us???  it finally is us.  i want them to win just like every other red sox fan but the longtime diehard fans will understand when i say i am just thrilled to see them in the world series again....yes, i am old enough to remember them in their last world series.....shit man....it's been a long time coming.  bring on saturday!!!!  woooo-hooooo!!!
1	So i gust got home from school.  Nick gave me a ride home he is so cute.  but anyway we were talking and we have decided that the dating show thing at school is stupid and ect. so like the dance is coming up and im wondering if it will be fun i don't know how to dance though so that might be a problem.  on Valentin's day i want to git nick a present and a rose-a-gram but i have no money so if anyone wants to donate to the GET NICK A GIFT FO VALENTIN'S DAY ill be hear well thats it so later         PS.  If some one knows wat Nick likes tell me because i got nothing
0	So I went to my friends earlyer to help him set up his new desk, and computer. I was on the ground quite a bit, and keep rolling on my keys so I decided to take them out of my pocket.  Big  fucking mistake, I didn't drive to his house, I had another friend drive me there so I didn't really think anything of it when I left his house without my beloved car-keys. Fortunatlly after beating on my door to be let in for 10 minutes I found another set of keys, so I can atleast get to school tommorow.  Unfortunatlly this means I can no longer make fun of my dumbass friends who lock their shit in their car/house.  I think I just one upped  alot of people :(
1	Wow …… What a brilliant time I had at bicon.  As well as my usual friends I met so many great people, and so many sexy ones too.  I’m really looking forward to seeing all the new people again or keeping in touch. Thanks Bicon organisers.
0	Post one of your memories about me. It can be anything you want. Then post this into your journal. See what people remember about you.
1	Monday was the best day I've had in a long long time. My classes went by fast, I got to go to the art museum with Kate, then go out drinking with Owen and Deqlan to celebrate and blur my 21st birthday (Thanks!). Today I shake off my headache, go to class, and have dinner with my mom. Good days kick ass.
1	Todd got me something almost better than diamonds. Actually it was exactly what I wanted, a bar for the apt! Also, roses are on the way! Getting more bar stuff tomorrow!     
1	Happy Birthday       sonnlich   !   (Actual journalling may or may not happen later)
0	    Yeah, so thats my phone... Except mine is this blackish dark green color. Yeah...  Never thought it could amuse me this much, but going on the interenet on it and looking at the weather...Well... Yeah.  Anyways...  Almost Turkey Day... Mmmm... Turkey...  HA!  Im just going to add more tot his entry now...  So I went to dinner tonight at Uno's, it was good.  What else?  Today sucked ,actually.
1	One year. Holy shit.     This, I think, is a good way to celebrate:    Hello, I've waited here for you...everlong. Tonight, I throw myself into and out of the red, out of her head she sang.  Come down and waste away with me, down with me. Slow how you wanted it to be. I'm over my head, out of her head she sang.  And I wonder, when I sing along with you: if everything could ever feel this real forever. If anything could ever be this good again. The only thing I'll ever ask of you, you've got to promise not to stop when I say when.  Breathe out, so I can breathe you in, hold you in, and now I know you've always been out of your head, out of my head I sang.  And I wonder, when I sing along with you: if everything could ever feel this real forever. If anything could ever be this good again. The only thing I'll ever ask of you, you've got to promise not to stop when I say when.
1	I never thought that I'd miss having a phone line..I feel disconnected from the outside world..I feel like I'm in a terrible twilight zone here at work..AAHHHHH...Not that anyone of any importance is trying to reach me, but still..It's just the point of it all...Actually, a phone just rang...maybe, just maybe we'll be back in working service before too long, I sure hope so..It's been such a busy week.  It's already Thursday and tomorrow is Friday..Yeah!  It's so beautiful today that I almost feel like going to grab a margarita after work..However, I need to workout too..Geez decisions, decisions,...should I go with the good or bad side of my mind..I could workout for a while and then go..I guess we'll just have to see..I love the spring time.  It's so nice outside and I'd much rather be out there than stuck inside here..I think it's a case of serious spring fever...
1	Hello All,      I will be leaving for Boston tomorrow (Saturday) and will not return for a week!  I will be back in Birmingham 3 April...which is Sunday, and the last day of Spring Break for we UAB folks.        If I have access to the internet while I'm up there, I'll be updating my lj with details of my trip.  I will bring some shit back for you...but I don't have a lot of money...so it's going to have to be knick-knacky stuff that doesn't cost much.         I'm excited!  And those of you who are going to the beach...I feel sorry for you.  *sticks out tongue*                                        Love,                                        Kevin
0	     How sad is this...       &nbsp;     Dear Mike,       sorry I had not time to write you..I just wanted to warn you : I'll stay the whole month in Lyon..So that means no more writing during one month ! That's really annoying..But I've got to make sacrifices to make it ! So have a very good month LOL I'll miss my best friend in the USA...  France        I will miss this lovely young lady... :'(        &nbsp;      &nbsp;

0	I feel kind of pathetic.  I thought my witty play on word skills were better than I guess they actually are.  I just realized the humor in the fact that the local livejournal meetup is held at a place named L J's Coffee Shop.    Deities of comedy, I beg your forgiveness.  --J
1	      julian814    has GRACIOUSLY volunteered to design and host a webpage for us!!  So now we need to decide what we want to say on it.  =)  Also, I'd like to get a vote on whether or not we want to try and affiliate with Mothers Against Drunk Driving.  I think it would be a good idea, but I don't want to speak for everyone.  So please respond here with your ideas for the webpage, as well as your feelings about becoming a part of M.A.D.D. - if you say no, please explain why.  You might have a good point that none of us considered before.

0	Well, Happy Easter, folks.  My Easter's been pretty swell.  I hope the same applies to all of you.  I love Easter Dinner.  Especially that wine-and-large-meal induced nap which inevitably follows.    I am very very sad right now.  Tomorrow, everything's going to go back to normal.  I don't want that.  This has been one of the best weeks of my life, and I don't want it to end.  I have so much to do.  So many major projects due in the next few weeks which I have yet to prepare for... Not to mention that daily school work which will do more than enough to keep me occupied.  I'll miss you guys for the next eight weeks.  It's going to be tough...  The anticipation of pure misery is getting me down.  But there's nothing I can do to stop it.    Hmmm...
1	psych developing skills class was interesting today. before class a few of us were sitting on top of the desks talking and most people, when they came in, would sit down in a chair. so Dr. Wann decided to test the notion of conformity. he closed the door and told everyone to stand up and then sit on top of their desks, like me and a few other people were doing. the first person to walk in after we did this conformed and sat on top of the desk like the rest of us. to prove the point of conformity again Dr. Wann had us all sit in the chairs and, yet again, the next person to walk in conformed and sat in a chair. it really shows how people do conform to what the larger group is doing so they don't look out of place. and i know i do it to. it just goes to show how humans behave in social situations.
0	well thomas came to see me yesterday. we had fun i miss him and i have not seen him in forever.  i watched QAF til i fell asleep at like 8 am i think and i slept till 4 pm go me heh heh heh. played Xenosaga today and got to where i was before in it and got my ass kicked. and of course my friend brad thinks its funny. anywho on to more serious things.  i havent been feeling better. its the few moments i get to spend with friends but thats about it ya know.  i have become convinced that life as i knew it is gone and i am to be miserable the rest of my life.  How much longer will i let this go on?  how much longer til the rest of my life...
1	I love talking to him.  Whenever I am down, he picks me up.  We laugh together, we cry together.  We tell each other our deepest and darkest secrets.  He holds me when I fall asleep, and will listen to me when I'm having problems.  I love falling asleep at night, and knowing that my best friend is just a phone call away.  And I know that no matter how horrible my day has been, I will always get an "I love you."  And just those three simple words seem to melt the troubles of my day into nothingness.  What I love the most though, is having nothing to do but talk to him for hours on end.  : )
1	I made it to North Carolina ok and i'm having lots of fun.... I will be back home on saturday night y'all take care and i'll talk to y'all later....  Courte'Merde
1	Today has been, so far, a great day!  If I were to mark it out of a possible 10, I think today has been a 9 for definite.  yup yup yup  Good day.  Work's not bad, haven't got  much  on, but I've not been twiddling my thumbs all day, which is always good for an easily bored me.  Have been merrily catching up on emails, which I don't do as often as I should, but I'm making a conscious effort to try and stay more in touch with my mates.  It's another  lovely  day, the sun is shining, the sky is blue, and even the rubbish traffic on my way home at lunch time was bearable. Mainly due to a friend of mine, who sent me some excellent tunes yesterday, which just keep making me smile from one ear to the other! *Thanks Phil!*  So, that's pretty much it for today. If only I had something else to enthuse about - I'm in an enthusing mood for some reason. I even found myself Tra La La-ing round my room last night. Strange sight, let me tell you! Frightening really!  over-and-out!
0	i saw the absolute saddest thing I've seen in my life.  There was a dog running on the side of the road dragging one of its back legs behind him.    I  cried .      My grandpa (moms dad) is in the hospital for puking up blood.
1	It is kitty kat mania at the Vatsa/Payne household. Lemme explain.   Katie,my roomie, being the good hearted gal that she is agreed to kitty sit 6 (count 'em) 6 baby kitties for 2 weeks. Please let me know if you or anyone you know is in the market, they are adorable!
0	. Every so often, I see a flicker of light through the black clouds of the mass human soul...    Lisa de Moraes in her column in  The Washington Post  on Peter Jackson:    And, you have to admit, even 43 million viewers would be an incredible accomplishment for a four-hour broadcast that was monopolized by a fat, rumpled, dreary little man -- given that most people watch the Academy Awards to spend quality time gazing on beautiful, slender, glamorous and, at least superficially, interesting movie stars.     Then again. .
1	techno-gadget-gamer-geek that I am, I decided to not do anything useful with  my tax rebate checks. Instead, I pre-ordered a PSP. Yay. If I wanted to, I could go get it in 14 min,  but I'd rather sleep and let them plow the roads. So tomorrow I get to go to GameStop at the Short Hills Mall (they are very nice... they guaranteed I'd get one from the first shipment since I work in the mall ^_^), and give them $200, and they give me a PSP. I gotta decide what game(s) I want, though. Thinking Tony Hawk and/or Ape Escape. &lt;3 Tony Hawk games.  *prays for a snow day so she can play video games ALL DAY. yay.
1	 http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.b ml?journal=emeldir&itemid=4526&thread=20398#t20398   Are we going to Minas Tirith, then?  It's all chaotic and full of destruction anyway.  It'll be easy to sneak in and get that Palantír.
0	Its been awhile but here I am. Im finally updating. R.S. is moving to California. We're really going to miss her. She's leaving wed. I think? We had a party for her last night and it was fun. It was just a few people but it was really fun. Karoaoke, sparkling cider and ghost in the graveyard. Oh yeah and toilet paper wars. School is going to be so different w/o her. She better come back to go to Camp Texlake though. She has to sign the Skipper plaque. And she has to go rock climbing w/ us. Anyways I have to work at Wurstfest on Friday(which R.S. is going to miss). Im gonna go sulk now.
1	Yeah yeah - so what if my birthday is in November.  Today I booked a cruise for November 2006!  It's on the newest ship in RCCL's fleet.  It's not even in service yet!  So excited!!!  Yay!  A 7 day cruise!!  Woowoo!!!
0	I just sat today, for about 12 minutes. Not sure how I feel. Just depressed I guess. I feel very unconnected to people right now. I wish I had people to sit with. I feel like I very much so need to sit with people, but I don't have that. The people I know who sit are either far away or I rarely see them anyway, and the people I see all the time don't sit. And if I do sit on my own it makes me feel disconnected from the people I spend time with because it's not something they understand or have even experienced. Everything feels all wrong, like all the pieces in my life just don't quite match up. I feel like I've been withdrawing into myself lately, when what I really want is to connect to people. Hopefully I'll end up sitting with Dan and Neal next quarter on saturday mornings.
1	Tonight, Thursday, March 10, 2005, 8:00 PM. Pegasus Grand Ballroom, Student Union, UCF. Landon and Josh rocking out for your listning pleasure.  Be there.

1	Yay, Sarah called!! Yay, I got put on an easy survey today! Yay, it's the weekend! Yay, I get to see Dru after he's done working! Yay, my kitty is cute! Yay, fat hamsters!   Did I mention, "Yay, Sarah called?"  I haven't talked to her in a year, cause she was in T-dot.  I'm so excited!  She left a message on my machine, so I'm assuming she's back in town and I want to give her a big, big HUG!
1	FOIU#Oih293naiuyufh89uyueiayui28o375orha! !!!!   RED SOX!!!  WORLD SERIES!!!!   FUCK THE YANKEES!!!
0	Just had one of those evenings where I feel like I've been such a bitch to/about everyone, so if that's you I do apologise.  I feel like if I just do one misjudged or nasty thing everyone will discover I'm a horrible person and they won't want to know me any more.  x
0	SO shits been going bad lately.I've been harrassed and bitched at and honestly i really just cant take it anymore. i hate everything rightnow. i want to cry, i want to scream. i want to do anythign to make this pain go away.i hate Ramono so much. i hate kyaliegh with a passion. they just aren't good people. i just dont know what i'm going to do.  goodbye,  kate
1	Today I woke up later than planned... in a wonderful mood! I had somethings to get done around the house... and I still need to do some more cleaning and stuff, but I at least got somethings started. Today has just been wonderful! I went to lunch with Cameron and then took him to campus to show him around... since he'll be going to school there in the fall. Showing Cameron around made me even more excited to have him and a bunch of our other friends coming to UNCC in the fall! Its gonna be a total blast... although my Summer won't be there... and that breaks my little heart. I hope that you all are having a wonderful day... I am! And now I'm gonna go spend some time with the love of my life... the man that died for me... Jesus Christ! Happy Good Friday!  *leave me some lovin'*  ~Jax
0	I cried so hard today....People are so rude and ignorant...Todays lunch time fiasco may have seemed humoress to others but I am very hurt and upset by it.....Maybe no one else understands why......But I am done caring what certain people think of me, their opinions arent worth it.
1	I feel better today....   Umm.... me and Chris talked... We're not boyriend and girlfriend... but we're something close to it...   But i think im pretty much happy with the situation.. or it could be just the prozac in my system still... hehe...   ....No ... it is just that i feel better...  ... *happy*       
1	Well I did it, yay for me.  Mine and Rachels wedding was beautiful we couldnt have asked for more.  I had a blast im just kind of sad its over now.  We also are renting a nice house with a big red barn in the back, its really cool.  We are on just about 2 acres and we have a river at the end of our back yard, me and Rachel are very happy about the place, there is a church about 3 houses down so we are bringing the girls this sunday.  I miss you guys   Here is my new address 5503 Naumburg Lane Castorland Ny, 13620  I will add my phone # when it gets cut on.  Love Jeff
0	so new years can be summed up in about two words i feel: drunken + violence. not neccesarily on my part but at the same time i feel i should send everyone i encountered that nite an apology card. which sucks a lot. i already know that my plans for next new years are going to be renting movies and drinking juice all by myself. i'm pretty excited about this prospect but it is a year away so we'll see.   so far i have 3 out of 4 grades in and i'm getting an A and two A-. now i just have to get my politics grade in and i can celebrate my being a genius again. i need something to do tonite but at the same time i think i want to just go read in the fort where it's warm and no one can bother me. instead i'll probaly be forced into going to jacob's parents house. oh well.
0	     ©    What's your Inner Goddess Color??  © Jen    hola..whats up?..school has started..going on 4rth week..and it's been hectic..but im surviving so far..lol well ima go..adios..         Stalk  bunnywunny_~!  
1	So, as many of you know, today is an important semi-official holiday.  That's right, its Warren's birthday.  (Oh, yeah, and some Irish saint guy too.)  One of the cool thing about Warren's birthday is that its exactly six months away from mine at the opposite end of the year.  This is pretty cool for a couple of key reasons.  One is that we get to hold the traditional really good birthday dinners at even intervals, and the other is that it makes the date easy to remember.  We'll be having dinner at the Julien tonight; I'll be wearing a green dress.
0	Ok so I basically just gave that match away. I lost it 6-1,2-6,3-6. Anyway, time to get back to school work...I'm just very dissapointed.
1	I totally have my license. But I'm so bummed, because I can't use it until I get my name in our insurance. That oculd take anywhere from an hour to a week. But still! It's pretty fucking cool.
1	Hey, so I'm in the room watching the O.C. whilst all the other girls are out in the jacuzzi.  Wow... what a crazy bunch... seriously... but still, I feel more like myself around them rather than when I'm around others that I see a lot of the time.  It's really strange how certain people will make you just... at ease and so comfortable.  I really appreciate people that will just take you in like that.  It makes me think I should be more accepting, blah blah blah stuff I learned today, lol.  So JACON hasn't even started yet but it's been pretty fun so far.  I can't wait for the "pajama party" on Saturday, lol.... I even got this pretty silky lacy blue lingerie top from Doni for FREE!  She's just like, "pick a color!" I forgot how awesome these anime cons are, I'm really glad I came, and I can't wait to see Alex tomorrow afternoon.  ^_^  Muah, kisses to all those that want them.  See ya'll later!  =)
0	thanks to everyone who commented on my last entry, if you didn't i'm still interested in knowing your opinions. yeah, sam and steff, good to hear from y'all.  so, boone frickin kissed me, ok so he was blotting his lipstick, but that does not make it less than totally disgusting. gross.  if you couldn't tell, i'm pretty stressed and feeling kinda unloved right now. i know life is unfair, but why can't it ever be unfair in my favor. i'm not the bad guy, i didn't do anything. so, why is everything falling apart?  now that everyone's totally confused, good news: all my classes tomorrow are canceled! i don't have to go to makeup next week cause its all disaster drill stuff, and i might go into shock, or something.   at least next week i won't be pulling double duty on shows.
0	We have one or two long-shot chances, but without a miracle, the museum is dead.
1	I've just accepted an offer on my house, which I have to sell. I'm down-sizing, and had an offer accepted on a smaller house.  I'm going to have to get rid of a lot of stuff: possibly some furniture, but mainly clutter.   Of course what one is happy throwing out, and what one feels one must keep, in indicative of where one's values lie. And where one's neuroses lie!  Difficult but necessary; hopefully it will enable one to move on both in practical, concrete terms but also in psychic terms.  Has anyone else been involved in life laundry, whether it be concrete, practical, intellectual, emotional, spiritual etc?  T
1	Oi Minna!  I’m officially the owner of Yami’s apartment! *smiles* I’m packing as I type, I know that’s hard but hey the faster I get to my new apartment, the faster I can party! Can’t wait to throw my own party without my dad to say no about it. *rolls eyes*   I might be offline for a while since I need to install this comp over there, but I’ll try to update this as soon as I can. Even if it means going to the *shudders* library. You know how boring libraries can be, I hope I don’t resort to that.  Hope dad doesn’t blow a gasket for me leaving, he can take care of himself. Can’t wait to tell Shizuka, she’ll be the first person I call from the apartment. I heard that she got a new cell, wonder what her reaction will be to see a number that’s unknown to her?  Anyway, this will be a short post since well got a lot of packing to do, new apartment here I come!  Oyasumi Minna!  ~ Katsuya
1	grab your joystick and let her be your playstation!         -from one of the audience members of the Ricky Lake show today!
1	Thank you to everybody who made this con a great success for me.  I had the Godzilla table. You guys made me be one of the most successful there...if not the most successful....I have no idea what anybody else did but some did hardly a thing....not to down on anyone.  Because of you I will be back next yr.  I hope you guys make it just as enjoyable for me as I hope I make it for you.  thank   Chris
1	Yesterday I got the Lonely Planet guide to Bejing, just because I like having something hardbound to read and get excited about.  I've totally been surfing the web and theres tons of great stuff out there - but theres just something about having an actual book.    Anyhow - here are the things the law school has planned for us already:      The Forbidden City      Tiananmen Square      The Great Wall      The Summer Palace     The Llama Temple (couldn't find a good link on this one)      Anyhow - so thats all the major stuff already planned for us.  Now - I need to do research on what I need to do on my own.  :)  Damnit - I should be studying.  Damnit damnit and more damnit.
0	yea i know.. its such a big surprise... life sux i have people telling me they love me i have people being an ass to me and i just cant take it anymore. i wish i could just die! but mahly tells me i cant go cause she loves me. but i know she means it cause she has for the last 5 years! but i g2g hopefully ill talk to u all later malhy is calling me!
0	what do you do when you really really like someone, but they are TOTALLY on the rebound?
0	So i thought today was going to be an awesome day. But it has turned out to an okay day. Really nothing happening. i went and got my oil changed and saw Randy. I don't know what is going on with him. he is kinda acting weird toward me. We don't really talk anymore when i stop in and visit him. Then i went and bought some make-up. Buying make-up always makes me feel better. So i spent almost $60 today. Which was all the money i had :(  We just got a new carpet in the living room. So when i got home i put all the funture back. And now i'm will be leaving for work in about 10-15mins. Then i will be bored at work for the next 8 hours.   Last night Texas Roadhouse people came in and started bugging me. They were very needy and annoying. I stuck around for a little bit with Shelley. Then some of her friends came in so i left. Sat at home for a bit, talked with people and went to bed.   Now i must get ready for work.  later

0	  And did those feet in ancient times trod on America's pastures of green? And did that anthropocentric God wane with their thoughts and beliefs, all unseen? I don't think so, he's up there with the others lying low; vying with those who you traded your life to bless your soul. And have they told you how to think, cleansed your mind of sepsis and autonomy? Or did you escape from scrutiny, and regale yourself with depravity?  Now we all see: religion is just synthetic frippery, unnecessary in our expanding global cultural efficiency.  Now we all fear this impasse we have built to our future; ever so near, and oh so austere. 
0	To sleep and to dream.  To dream and to live.  To live and to love.  To love and to wake.  To wake and to die.
0	Here I am stuck in the damn HBM computer lab, and oh how I hate my life right now! I just wish there was a light at the end of the tunnel, because it feels like I'm buried under a pile of shit. I just found out that Kalyn's group spent 4 hours in the lab. That's gonna be fun since I don't get in here until after 8pm! And my boy is being a major prick right now, I don't appreciate it.
1	back at school and loving it - wow i never thought i would say that- anyway going to buy books today i am actually pretty excited for this semester except for i really don't wanna go out cus its freakin 12 degrees out - i do miss my marblehead friends who will def come visit me this semester and vice versa but i love my room i love my roommate and i love my classes- i am i happy - well maybe just a little

1	Meet at Chez Turtle at noon.  We will pile into as few cars as possible to get people over there.  We should be back to Chez Turtle by 6, when dinner will start.  The "party" part of the day will start after dinner, probably around 7.  Feel free to show up any time after 6 if you are not going to the museum with us.  I know people RSVPed for this already, but I would like to see a list of names of people who I will be expecting (and somewhat waiting on) tomorrow before we all head out.  So please reply with how many people you are bringing, and whether or not you car is large enough to haul a significant number of people.  I hope to see you guys there!
1	Hooray! Hooray! The first of May! Outdoor screwing begins today! :)  Happy Beltane to all those who may observe it as well. :)  Went out last night. I've got to remember my tolerence isn't very high when it comes to hard liquior. One shot just about did me in. Otherwise I only have four beers in four hours. So meh.   Wimbledon and St. Averil have been scratched from the Derby. More to come.. !!! :)
0	im so worried. i hope everyone is alright in san diego. i miss you guys and i love you all! take cares and be safe! i heard its never been that bad before. it sucks cause i cant even picture in my mind what san diego could look like. supposedly the sky is orange, and theres ash everywhere. damn it sucks to be so helpless.
1	I had a reall fun weekend.  On Friday I went to a chaminade baskett ball game and then went to alesios with andrea and then just hung out at her house.  Saturday was boring but then on Sunday andrea came to my dads house and we went to the mall, ( I bought a new skirt and andrea bought some shoes), Buca De Bepo, and then played pool, and watched these REALLY stupid, wierd, hallarious movies. It was soo cool bc they were sooo stupid that they were funny.  Then we just hung out at mi house today and we took her home at like 6.  I had Stone fire for dinner and my grandma and grandpa are here.  Thursday and Friday will be fun bc I want ashley heather and andrea to come over and then on friday I might go to the movies with kristina and some other ppl.I hope u guys all had a great weekend! &lt;3luv yaz

1	Okay.  So.  I haven't been drunk in a long while.    Tonight's the night.   Kristen  and I are partaying.  Miller's style.  If anyone wants to come there and stalk us, we should be there.  Maybe we'll venture out into other bars.  It'd be a first with the both of us together.  Heh.  I'm going to town with her to return some stuff that I bought.  Because some ubum is differnt and some ubum's de same.  My room is almost completely ready for moving in.  Now I'll have a computer room and a sleeping room.  My computer room will be chaos, because that's what my computer is, and my sleeping room will be calm and serene.  Because that's what sleeping is.  Makes sense, right?  WOO!
0	What now, oh broken heart, oh lonely sorrow? Why now have you become so loud and deep? What soon shall happen to the drink you feed on Since longer not will you be put to sleep?  A candle burns most violently, they tell me, When flame and power it is soon to lose. So do you wish to now produce a memory, That in your death, at least you'll leave a bruise?  What stubborn will hath sorrow in its dying! What strength is given it by loneliness! And as they roll and tumble with each other, What loss one takes when soon dealt aidlessness!
0	The patriot act.  A while ago Jenny explained this to me.  I just now heard of it on my local channel six news.  The library can't say if we have it there or not, but I'm assuming by the way that they were acting, our library books are now being watched.  I wonder if soon your purchases will be watched too.  President Bush is really a very dissapointing man.  In fact, he's beyond dissapointing.  I don't think they've invented a word for him yet.
1	I got great news...I got July 5th to the 12th off meaning...IM GOING TO AC THIS YEAR! I got the hardest thing done! Im so excited!  Im gonna take many pics and give so many hugs to everyone.

After work Im helping a friend hand out invites and then Ill give you a call to meet up. Okies? :) And Alma.. *SNUGS!* I miss you! I hope you got my email :D Now off to finish this great day!

1	So, uni began today.  I have an awesome timetable this session.   Mon:  Class 9-1  Tues:  Class 9-11  Wed:  Free  Thurs:  Class 9-1  Fri:  Class 9-11  I have to fit in work and my internship somewhere, but that will be easy. I *love* that I have morning classes, it will force me to get up. I always feel fine once I'm up, it's just getting there...  I would prevously have had 11-1 and 2-4 on Mondays and Thursdays, but I changed my 2-4 class to a 9-11. Which was miraculously easy. I walked up to the faculty office, and said,  'I know this is a long shot, but is there any chance I could change from class xxxx to class xxxx for subject blah?'  And she said, 'There's one spot left. I'll put you in.'  And that was it.  In my  six years  of university, I have never had such a mind-boggling easy timetabling experience. All my timetable karma (ie, taking crappy classes because I lived on or near campus) has finally paid off.
1	 I'm going home!! I can't wait...I'm going to see BCHS do "Seussical the Musical" Saturday night...I love going back and watching the plays...It's just weird being in the audience and not up there with them...Ashleigh, are you still going with me and Meghan? I reserved three tickets so just let me or Meghan know. I hope you guys all have a great weekend and I'll talk to you soon!! Love you!! 
1	While I was in British Columbia the last couple days visting Whitefox and company, we stopped by the Virgin Megastore in downtown Vancouver.&nbsp; There, I spent way too much money on overpriced CDs.&nbsp; What did I pick up, you ask?&nbsp; Why, I'll tell you!  Akufen - Fabric17 DJ Krush - Jaku E-Z Rollers - Titles of the Unexpected...

1	I went to Salem tonight with Kat to see Jamie's new band, The Fuel Injectors, play.  They were good, especially considering it was their first show.  Besides, I just really like watching people play who really enjoy playing.  And it was clear that Jamie, Chris, and Olan all love what they do.  And I talked to Lucy for a bit, and she is just generally a good time too.  I still wonder why Kev brings his camera places.  I have yet to see him actually use it. ~Mandy
0	Well I got my stupid math test back....beyond bombed it.  I am too embarrassed to even post my grade on here b/c it was that bad.  I am sooo beyond depressed, these have been the crappiest 2 weeks of my life.  I just want to go home, crash out & forget about everything. Like almost everyday I've been crying, i'm so sick of crying, so tired of feeling sad all the time.  I'll probably have to q-drop that class, but it means i'll be under 12 hrs, which could screw everything up....but looking at it this way, is it worth all the misery that I am facing?  I am in just a bad bad situation & i don't know what to do.
1	From now to Sunday the 24th I'll be puppy sitting in Shelburne,  So, contacting me will be shaky, try the cell phone, leave a message if I don't answer, good luck!
1	So the past couple of weeks have been kinda mixed.  A lot of things just happened really suddenly.  But enough of the bad.    The good things that happened:  -Dad Came back from Taiwan  -Got Kung Fu Hustle on dvd  -HUGE graduation present from my aunt  -Got a date for prom  Yea... some of you may think this is a lame entry but whatever... It's my journal.    O yea, happy early birthday kevin!
0	Mom's pretty much at the end of her rope.  She just started as a nursing home attendant making single digits.  Her middle-age, lack of schooling, and simple English doesn't allow her to do much else in the job world.  So she pretty much has to deal with crotchety old people who don't want to accept the fact that they're no longer spring chickens.
1	 i am a machine fueled by oil and the blood of foreigners.  i am a tool forged with silver and gold - obedient to my builders of affluence and wealth.  i am unwavering! incapable of fault! and steadfast in principle against the voices of reason!  I am the empire! i am the end! i am your almighty commander and god!  I am your new america! i am george bush! 
1	So, some seriously f'd up shit went down at my work friday..changing the work environment significantly for the worse.  While I can't fix what had been change... I think I can take the reigns and make it a productive workplace. I beleive I know most of what's wrong and how to fix it. And I think with some support from my friends I may just be able to pull it off.  To pull this off I'll have to be the most driven I have been in years. But I want it. I will have it. And so will those around me.
1	Everyone's icons are a lot more fun now that we've been revealed.  I need to make myself some new ones.
0	though i'm not sure, I think I may be depressed.  Here are some reasons why on a scale of 10, 10 being  the best....  friends- 2 girls  - 1 social life - 4 work - 6  see none of them are too high...especially when compared to the past.    I feel really alone, like today, I worked 11 hours and when I got in my car to see if I missed any calls, I saw that I didn't because no one wants or likes to talk to me!  blah, i hate you all!
1	i'm leaving on a jet plane dont know when i'll be back again  ...headed to ireland for the week
0	I grieve with you, and for you.  Take the time you need to take, feel the feelings you need to feel, and don't let anybody (including yourself) rush you, and above all don't let anybody (including yourself!) trivialize your grief.  Grief is grief.  Our emotions don't know from people or critters or cheese sandwiches - it's all grief.  And don't be surprised if *this* grief brings up other, older grief, cuz emotions don't know from time, either.  It's all one.  FWIW, I don't even doubt that all our critters who had to leave us are hangin' together in one big poly critter family, having a blast and enjoying tales of the hairless monkeys they lived with...  love and hugs  Linda

1	I love my co-workers.  Why?  I'll give you an example.  As the Sunday Morning Praise program was winding down on the radio, I turned to my co-worker (Josh) and ask him about lap dances.  He doesn't blink an eye; he's used to these sorts of spontaneous questions from me.  So he answers them: what exactly does a lap dance entail, how much, where are they conducted, it is true that touching isn't allowed, etc.  After five minutes, I know everything I need to know.  *sigh*  My co-workers are better than an encyclopedia.  And I can get all the info I need without ever having to, say, get drunk or go to a strip club.  Just thought I'd share.

0	      I took the  What Mythological Creature Are you?  test by       peacefulchaos    !   /me whinneys  Yay.  Horse-man am I.  Oh, BTW, playing The Sims 2, I made Daniela and Myself in it and the resemblances are GOD. DAMN. SCARY.  It's funny, since you choose how they act through their astrological signs (myself, a libra and Daniela a Scorpio) she's always clinging to me and I'm always thouroughly enjoying it. :P  She gets along with everyone in town and I'm always annoying them by laughing too loud at jokes. She always laughs when I tell her a dirty joke, too.  I reccomend buying or finding a friend who owns it and making people you know, in it.  It's crazy accurate.
1	Okay, I just wanted to say: I put a new pic of Dusty and me on my webpage. I love it, I think we both look really good in it. We're just chillin' and killin' at my house :)  *** http://jesicaw.netfirms.com/ ***  Well.. I went out w/ my parents today. That was fun, I guess. Got me outta the house. Went to the mall.. bought nothing. Bought a soft thang that goes on your seat belt so it wont cut your throat thang, though. My passenger seat needed it, I was tired of my mom complaining so, I made her buy it :P Smart, huh? Heehee..  I guess I'll go now! Bye  ~Jes
1	Well, i haven't been here for a while, not done anything worth writting about really!, Managed to get my car fixed and back on the road, with the help of my younger brother and father. Spent most of the time at home, listening to music, working on a few mini projects, and also one not so mini project....  Last night spent a lovely evening in the company of a few japanese friends, who cooked a traditional japanese meal, then washed that down with about 5 bottles of red wine... Woke feeling not too bad, then went shopping at Tescos. Cooking a sunday Roast for the house today!  Hope i can remember how to do it!
1	Gacked from       roncha78       1. What was the first band you saw in concert?  It was...the Backstreet Boys. *ducks tomatoes being thrown*  2. Who is your favorite artist/band now?  NSYNC, Christina Aguilera  3. What's your favorite song?  I have no clue.   4. If you could play any instrument, what would it be?  I'm learning how to play the piano now so I guess that doesn't count. How about the guitar.  5. If you could meet any musical icon (past or present), who would it be and why?  Man, there is so many to chose from. Of course, NSYNC. Janet. Madonna.  I am off for a relaxing day of shopping and bonding and spending cash! Have a good Friday ok.
0	i was searching through petfinder.com because i'm bored and i came across her......     she looks  EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY  like a dog named Betty me and Kevin had for 4 days that suddenly died one night, and we still don't know what happened to her. I seriously can not get over how exactly alike they look. I think they were both 16 pounds even(Betty might have been 14 pounds). They both have a rediculous underbite too. The only difference is this girl has black around both her eyes, Betty only had black around one of her eyes. She was such a unique looking dog that it is a shock to me that i found another one who looks exactly like her. This dogs name is Cassy and it says her adoption is pending. If that wasn't the case, and i could take another dog right now, i would have her in a heartbeat.  I miss my silly Betty. 
0	okay im leaving already...hope everything goes for everyone...bye ppl...will miss you guys...     The view from my house...hope i'll be able to come back to see it again...

1	 You might be thinking about sex if…   1. You become suspiciously preoccupied with what you’re doing instead of what others are doing. 2. You stop hunching over. 3. You stop fidgeting. 4. You dig your ass into the chair like you’re trying to push the chair back. 5. You get a glass of water to moisten your lips with less grossly obvious lip-licking. 6. You swallow more frequently, even if you don’t need to. 7. Despite it being to your detriment, you make every effort to appear bored and uninterested in everything that’s going on. 8. You start faking sickness to explain the blushed face.   :D
1	hey! well yesterday after school i went over to kelsey edmonsons house and we hung out and then beth came and we all watched The Notebook and finished up our shirts! it was really fun! then we hung out for a while and went online lol idk at like 2 we went to bed but we talked till 3! we woke up at 1230ish and made breakfast and cookies, at like 230 i went home and downoaded stole! gosh i love this song! at like 330 i went to kelsey and beths game with Kelly and Katie! now im making these cookies and Katie, Kelsey, and Beth (Kellys coming later!) are coming over in like 10 minutes and were gonna go to subway and get movies then they might sleepover but we dont know yet! hmm well i have to go because the cookies are ready!  
0	RIP John Peel  Just received an email from Si Jones to say that John Peel died late last night while he was on holiday in Peru. I feel saddened by the news as he was one of those British radio institutions that you think will be around for ever

1	I'm redoing my bathroom making it oriental....very chinese looking to match with the beautiful picture of an asian woman that is in there. So if anyone has some pictures of chinese symbols having to do with bathrooms (water, shower, waterfall, blue), please send these to me.
1	I had so much fun tonight:)  So, our knight was hot.  He had JG hair!!  (man this obsession is going overboard)  He was kind of a mix between Josh and Orlando Bloom... mmm:)  I went with Dave & his family for his grandfather's and brother's birthdays.  They both got knighted.  Really cute:)  But I'm tired and I have to get up in 4 hours to work... so I must go to bed now.
1	yesterday was exactly six months from the first time we kissed. and our 6 month is the 28th, just felt like puttin it out there cause i was excited.
0	Well, now I understand why every girl wants to be Eponine.  Today was good until about ten minutes ago, but I guess I was expecting that to come around sooner or later, so I'm not really surprised.  It's my own fault for listening to Les Mis.  That was a mistake.  And yet I continue to do it.   I had a nice day at school.  It just goes to show that if you really want to, and you really try...you can have a good day from the own sheer force of your will.  My AP Euro paper's due date was pushed back to Monday.  Sweet.  David is a nice boy.  My birthday is in one month and four days.  I don't really have anything to say, I guess.   "The city goes to bed, and I can live inside my head..."

1	Happy Birthday, Bill!     May you always be older and wiser.    (It's doubtful you're wiser, but it is your birthday so I'll be polite.  You will, however, always be older.  On that we can be certain!)    
0	I just found out about 10 minutes ago that Hunter S. Thompson shot and killed himself tonight.  I don't understand why people think that they need to end their lives.  I mean, I understand the reasons people give when they're thinking of committing suicide; but I just don't get how they think there's no light at the end of the tunnel.  How can someone think they're so unimportant that they need to end their life???  Why don't they know that there's someone out there who needs them???  I wish I could understand, but even if I did, I would never agree.
1	Yes, as from the title I am sure you can tell I am quite happy, things between me and holly are looking quite good, slowly but surely she is warming up to me, we are cuddling and such, kissing is still something we have not done yet, and same with her saying I love you, but, time cures all.  She looks happy when she is around me, which is nice, she loved the necklace I bought her, same with the flowers, so, all in all, things are going good. Only problems at the moment, is that I will not be playing mucks for a while, maybe never again...actually, most likely never again, mucks take too much of my time, and that time, I would wish to spend with her, and her only, if I think about anymore problems, I will add them to the list, but for now,and most likely forever, she is worth those problems.
1	im dyeing my hair agian if it sokay with my mom im not going to do it like i said im going to, im going to put more blonde in it and some brown again but ya you all will see hopefully i can get it done soon  hope everyone had a great day
1	Well so much for my count down...lol!  Madelyn Grace Wettstain as most of you know was born on the 23 at 2:22 a.m. She is 6 pounds and 9 ounces and 18 inches long. She is the most beautiful girl in the whole world. I love her so much. Everyone should and is more than welcome to come and see her. I have been trying (yeah right) to take it easy the last couple of days. I hurt all over and I don't get much sleep. The funny thing about that is I don't even really care. It is all worth it! She is so pretty and is without a doubt the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me. Plus I have Chris and well the only way to describe him is to say that he is the best. Madelyn couldn't have asked for a better father!   Lots of love to everyone! Feel free to come and visit because nothing makes me happier than to show off this pretty little girl!
1	I went overboard, but it can't be helped.  Deadman Switch has to be one of the  gayest  best episodes EVER. :) :)                                                                
1	heyhey i dyed my hair last sat. so now its LIght brown in colour. shalene said i look quite spunky ah... yeah.. then the hair stylist cut in such a way that my hair had to be as messy as possible.  but dear serene doesnt know how to do such things ah.. haha.. so i just leave it as it is.. haha.. waste of money rite.
1	I woke up at 10... Stupid plumber-person woke me up. Around 2ish I picked up       sackofsentai    and       johnscreams   . We went to BK then got on the road towards Point Pleasant. We hung around the boardwalk, played video games, saw peoples that I know, we won stuff from the crane machine(a chicken, patrick from spongebob, a purple monkey, swiper from dora, animal, and a turtle). Good times. That's all I'm gonna say for now, it was lots of fun, good note to go out on. Next entry=Top 10's.  P.S.-To       longwindedsong   : 12.
1	         Your Rising Sign is Pisces                     Dreaming and introspective, you're often lost in your thoughts.  Which is okay by you... you're inner world is pretty darn awesome.    And while you are inwardly confident, sometimes you seem a bit unsure.  People often handle you more delicately than they need to.    You love luxury, and even if you're a bit broke, you want things to look "rich."  Mysterious and demure, you keep secrets about yourself to remain an enigma.         What is Your Rising Sign?

0	This morning my Aunt Vicki died, around seven am.  This has been a hard last couple of weeks with her in the hospital.  I don't really know what to say.  I'm not good at dealing with emotions, especially bad ones.  All I know is I don't like death, nor do I like taking about it, I hope this will help.  I hope Vicki is in a better place now.  I love you Vicki.

1	Well, since the spectre of the LiveJournal has reared it's ugly head again, so I thought I'd add a post so that you all know I'm alive... oh who am I kidding, the only people who read this are the people I see on IRC every day :)  Umm, yeah, well... HI EVERYBODY  I'M DANCIN' LIKE A MONKEY...
1	Before we start, yes, the pun in the title of this entry was fully intended.  So anyway, a friend sent me a link to this  stupid new Google game  which "aims to determine, from your name alone, the most dominant personality traits and give you a fun little recipe for your own personality cocktail"  So I stuck my name into the text box, and I must say, it was spot on! Here's the results.      How to make a Leif         Ingredients:   3 parts competetiveness  3 parts brilliance  3 parts leadership         Method:  Add to a cocktail shaker and mix vigorously. Add a little cocktail umbrella and a dash of curiosity        Username:       Personality cocktail  From  Go-Quiz.com  
1	Last night I had a really great idea that I'd like to get some feedback on. In order to know if it's worth pursuing, though, I'd like to have some idea of how many people read this web site.  If you're reading this right now,  please  comment on this post. If you're shy to admit you're reading my journal, then post anonymously if you'd like...it doesn't matter to me.
1	 I love bees!   Yeah, I'm such a sucker. Oh well... beats checkers.  Did I mention I hate checkers?  *smirk*
1	So our cabinets/fridge are down to:   1 can of Swanson beef broth a packet of generic-brand raspberry Crystal Light a package of frozen blueberries (probably freezer-burned) 2 bottles of water some chicken ramen half a jar of peanut butter a package of tea flavored green noodles  Mmmmmm. Looks like a healthy dinner of ramen and Crystal Light tonight. But there's good news-- my husband got the new job he wanted! YAY! And it looks like I'll be visiting NYC in May!
1	I get to see my baby in 8 hours and 15 minutes! *bounce*  I'm so excited :)  Pat and the girls are going with me so we can all see him/her.  Just a tiny little jellybean right now, but still, he/she is our baby!    I'm really worried about losing the baby.  I'm almost paranoid about it.  I'm sure this is a normal part of pregnancy - I'm pretty sure I did the same thing when I was pregnant with Cheyenne.  I can't help it.  So please keep your fingers crossed for us at 9:30 am, the time of my appt.
1	I bought several new books today. One is "Eats, shoots, and Leaves." I'm really looking forward to reading it. The other is "Stitch 'N Bitch" (which, coincidentally, is incorrectly punctuated...there should be an apostrophe both before and after the N, since the A and D are both being dropped..). It has some great patterns in it, so hopefully it will spur me to finish the baby blanket I've been putting off for the past few months. :)

1	Oh my fucking God!  I just wrote a full page about my trip to Turkey- and it got erased! I am going craaaaaaaaazy!  Laugh out loud! (Ô.o)  Oh well.... I'll give a recap of what happened then! :)  We went for 14 days, and it was the best trip ever! It even beats Spain (Ô.o)  hehe....  We lived at this great hotel, and all the servers/waiters were so adorable and fun, I went to "Street Bar" with them, and I talked with them all. It was so funny! :P And there was three pools, and one large pool section at the hotel, they had their own huuge garden, and just two seconds away was their own private beach, where you could go if ya wanted to! There was shows every night, entertainment in many ways! Comedy shows, dance shows, theater, you name it! Every night at 10 pm. And disco every night from 12 'till 04 am :p That was the best part of the day (or night so to speak :p ....) ! hahahaaa! :P :D  I gotta go because my dad tells me too! But I'll tell you everything later!
0	I misread the whole election.  I thought bush was going to crash and burn.  I guess I misunderestimated the power of the perceived homosexual threat.  Anyway, on a lighter note, it's november and I'm writing a  novel .

That's alot for a baby girl right?? and she had all this dark hair.. haha it made me laugh.   I felt really bad for my sister though, cuz she had to have a seasection..(haha i have no idea how to spell it) at the last minute, because the chord was wrapped around the baby's neck and stuff. yeaa so when the baby was born she was really out of it. i felt really bad for her, cuz seh looked so miserable.  I hope that doesn't happen to me though... you know?? cuz i want to be able to show how happy and excited i am and not feel like crap.   yeaa im getting off of what's important .. so anyways  YAYYYYYYYYY!! haha   k bye byeeeeee

0	i'm hard pressed for a hotline but you are only answering when you know it's time...   living out this life of endless lies and compliucations finding meaning in nothing and nothing is finding meaning in me    the hunger of a thousand souls is striving to stop starving in the eyes of the only one - the true one you know  a juggling act has befallen me but i keep dropping all the pieces at my feet and staring down in disbelief i find it is my life laying there in shattered memories...
1	I have now been accepted to the Indiana University School of Music, and additionally they offered me a considerable scholarship just based on my musical merit.  I am very happy right now.  My tone may not convey this, but trust me.
1	Poor aniki.  Gomen na.  I didn't want our game to end so soon, not when I can build the anticipation so much higher before it's over.   But beyond that, the oddest thing happened to me today on the way home from school.  I took a short cut on the way to Reina's house to return her notebook as she had loaned it to me so I could copy her notes.   Which meant going through  that  section of town.  An older gentleman pulled me aside and told me I had...what was his word?? OH!  A scrumptiously divine form and asked me if I'd work for him.    Our secret he said since I'm not quite the usual age for such things.  But, the pay he offered was extremely high and he said the tips would be lovely enough that I'd be able to support any habits I might have.   The idea was just too tempting to resist. I start tonight.  *peers at her  uniform *  I suppose I need to find a trench coat to wear over that on the way to work or my dancing might begin before I hit the stage.

Now I can go out and enjoy myself at night.&nbsp; Get a little dinner without a side of lung cancer.&nbsp; Have some drinks with the guys from work and not have to burn my clothes. I only wish all of Minnesota would adopt the ban.&nbsp; Last week I went to Old Chicago for lunch, and I sat in the bar cause I was alone.&nbsp; This jerk off gets up from his table and comes to the bar and sits next to me to smoke.&nbsp; Why? Cause his wife wouldn't let him smoke at the table. Thanks DICK!&nbsp; Now I have to smell like an ashtray for the rest of the day.  Viva la Smoking Ban!! Why can't we get this going on in Liberal Washington?&nbsp; Oh yeah, cause our temporary Governor is basing her new budget on Cigarette taxes.  Is Washington trying to make me leave?

Go here for details at the P&D website.   The book signing is from 7 to 8 PM.  If you haven&#8217;t heard about this wonderful book yet, you can read a few reviews  at Amazon .    In other good news--the Meehan&#8217;s gig this month is on FRIDAY!!!  Yeah!  I&#8217;m glad things worked out so that I can go support Kathryn at her book signing and still see ER at my favorite local place.

0	Hey!  I watched the movies "Ladder 49" and "Exorcist: New Beginning" today.  "Ladder 49" was such a good movie.  I tried so hard not to cry.  It was so sad.  I bought that movie.  I loved it.  It inspired me (LOL).  "Exorcist: New Beginning" was not a good movie at all.  I didn't like it at all.  It was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.  Last night I had fun.  Amanda and I went bowling.  I did so bad.  It wasn't even cool.  We seen a couple people that we knew there.  I seen Kelly and Amanda's friend Derek (I think his name is) was there.  Kelly was crackin me up.  She was all dancing and everything else.  It was funny.  Then Derek and Kelly were trying to make this chick jealous.  It was working too.  That was pretty funny too.  I went to the mall today and got some more ideas for a prom dress.  I need one soon.

1	In true Angie fashion, I've left this till the last minute, but well.  On Monday, I'm going to drive up to Seattle to visit many people.  I think that on the way there, I'm going to hug the coast, taking 1 and 101 as long as I can stand it, but both then and on the way back (like on I-5), I'd like to find as many random roadside tourist stops as possible, even if they're a bit off the beaten path.  Anyone have suggestions?  My wanderlust is mostly inspired by  American Gods , and I'd like to find a bunch of, well, places of power, but don't really know where to start.  My vague Google searches haven't turned up much of anything, and I didn't plan enough ahead of time to pick up books or something useful like that (plus, well, acquiring more books is not in the cards for me just now).  I'll be checking my email until I leave and while I'm gone (for the return trip), thanks in advance for any suggestions!
1	Note to self: Do not start slacking off during this final week and a half of school. Classes aren't over 'till they're over.  ------------------------  So I'm absolutely addicted to the newer Armor for Sleep album (What to do when you are Dead).  It's SO good, concept albums rule!  Oh yeah and the new Hot Hot Heat album is awesome as well!  Catchiest thing ever, I can't wait to check out their show next month!!
1	i forgot to mention like 2 weeks ago (jk. itll be a week on... saturday)&nbsp; that the time finally came.   i ate...  FISH  a big one like that. jk! i only had a peice of sushi. but still! it had fish and crab in it. 2 different living things. it was slimy and strange tho. :| i dont remember sushi/fish being like that! oh well. anyway yeah so now i am going to buy tuna and whatnot and live like a real poor person.  i feel like i am living in a weird alternate universe where everything is backwards. things are so wonderful. the sun is out. i am happy (like really happy) and yeah. wonderful. haha.
1	so i am happier today than i have been for awhile... i woke up this morning and decided that if i want things to be better maybe i should think more positively.  so thats what i have been doing today, and i have been relatively happy all day.  well, i guess that fact that i got some incredibly good news today has been helping my mood more.  my parents were actually nice when i told them and actually said they were proud of me, although my dad bitched about having to spend more money on me, but whatever... i hadnt heard them say anything good to me for so long, i cant help but be happy.  haha, and i let myself celebrate by going on a huge shopping spree this afternoon.  i got soooooo much stuff, woo hoo... now i gotta go find room for it all in my closet.
0	ok so i tried and well lets just say it didnt quite work..dont wanna say to much b.c it involves one of my friends who reads this..    w.e tho..i guess i like the other person better nyway..     im happy for them tho..    
0	i'm such a fucking head case. what the fuck is wrong with me?
1	um... hi!  ^_^  yea, I dunno what to write, and my mum wants me to add me to her friends list so...  I'll do it now ^_^    Ja ne!  -meow =^.^= (cat's face for my mum ^_^)   -velvetiine

1	Most of you know I say "Poop on Christmas" but, I wanna be positive, so lemme tell ya...  They want me to be a bartender at work already!!! Woo Hoo!!! One of the owners invited me and the other barback (they are long time friends) to his house to play pool. He told us "Bone up on your drinks, you may become bartenders sooner than you think"  I hope it's not before new years... I need to work on my speed still, and I don't wanna work with a brand new barback, a new POS (point of sale, not piece of shit) on a night THAT busy! But, fuck it, I'll do it! I'm so damn excited.  It's great working for people that recognize how much effort you put into something, aptitude etc. This is the first time in a long time an employer has had more confidence in me... than me. It makes me nervous, but it pushes me too. It's great!
1	Janine replied, and we're going to watch movies again on Friday night. She has two cellphone numbers, so she obviously hasn't been using the one I sent it to over the past couple of days. I was actually starting to think that something might've happened to her, and I told her so. :P   Wewt. :)
0	i feel so bad about losing my job in mcdonalds...surely i'll miss all my friends there and my work, but more or less i'm pretty sure they will miss me more...
1	Had the best day ever!  Clotheshow live for my birthday with my best friend, my mother who I love dearly and my best friends cousin, who is really cool.  I spent the best part of £100 but I don't care - there goes my Christmas AND Birthday money in one go but hey, c'est le vie!  I nearly had my arm falling off when I got back from the amount of stuff I was carrying but thankfully my dad ordered a Chinese once we got back and my hurting arm was forgotten.  "Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me..."
1	I can't wait to see Dear Frankie. I have to wait till March 18th though. :(  I skipped class again today. Boo me.   I wish I could cook. I'm starved. And I'm tired of eating sandwiches.  I joined hi5, and I have no clue what I'm doing.  I'm going to some service for SJHS tonight. I just wanna see who shows up, and I wanna see Rob. :)   What should I wear.. Hum...
0	really should be studying for my french test tomorrow, but i dont understand it, so, im not... yeah, thats really flawed logic. anyway. just posting on here cause, well, i... dont know. but i am. yeah... anyway. once again if you want my (very sad) icons, and random pictures i take, you can go to www.xanga.com/photoshop08 and if you want my day-to-day journal, www.xanga.com/samwisethebrave08. i post there everyday, and i dont have enough time (and this one has too many options) to post here regularly, so there you go.  thats about it.  la mort de Boone m'a fait beaucoup de peine.  well, i do know a little french.  -sobs- why boone?!?!
0	With all this hectic planning and emotional stuff going on, not to mention 12+ hours to be spent at some form of a funeral, it's really starting to seem like the biggest deal is made not out of your birth or wedding, but instead, your death.  Anyone else find that really depressing?
0	I know you've grown to hate me Even more than you have Grown to hate yourself But has it really made a difference? Sharing all that hate With someone else? Please tell me Are you really happy? Do you think he's really worth the pain? Tell me Are you really happy? Or did you simply throw our life away Just to be unhappy? Does he worship and adore you? Does he make you feel so Beautifully complete? Is your life so much better now? Or do the same Old demons haunt just me? Is he everything you've dreamed of? I'd imagine he is So much more than me You know I tried to make you happy But I believe You thrive on misery
1	went to run errands today with Kelly.. she needed to go to Gamestop and the grocery store.. so I took her.. good thing I did.. she needed to reserve a copy of Guild Wars and the guy gave her a copy of the beta.. and me one too since I already reserved mine and didn't get the free beta.. so yay! I also found a wireless controller for my Xbox.. cheap! Yay! So all day I have been bouncing around because I got the beta and a controller for super cheap.. yay! Happy! I hurt a lot.. but I am still happy.. and I started using colored pencils on the sketch I did.. woah.. it looks cool.. but I know I will have to scan it in again and do some better coloring on the computer..
0	I was born in 1980, the year of the monkey, so I always thought 2004 was my year. And it was good: I got a new and more stable job, I met new people, I got to travel to the southern part of the country, money came pouring in during the later part of the year, I even won a stand fan in a raffle during our lousy company Christmas party (this is the first time I won in a raffle)...  ...until HE broke my heart two days before 2005 sets in. :(   ***  The other night, I had a dream. I dreamed I was talking to God. I asked, "BAKIT ANG SAKIT, E NAGMAHAL LANG NAMAN AKO." :(  He hugged me tight and my tears fell as He answered, "ANAK, SOBRA KC."
1	Okay, so my plane takes off in about 5 hours, but I'm writing this now since I probably won't have time to later. As I've metioned before, I'm going up to MA 'til the 7th of August. Communication of the internet variety will be little if any so I just wanted to say "bye" for the time being.   Be back soon! ~ 
1	Revenge of the Sith is now OFFICIALLY the first and only Star Wars movie to be rated PG-13.
1	My rig is complete. She's alive!   Now trying out WinXP 64. Seems like windows XP when it first came out... drivers are lacking.   Will continue testing...
1	I can't wait until October 24th, the new Cruxshadows cd Ethernaut comes out.  I have already heard sound clips from it and what I have heard sounds awesome.  I have money this time to buy it. Yea, and I know exactly where I am going to find the cd.  Well I am off to share my excitement with some people. ~*Ciao, Rogue*~
1	First of all my shinn/luna FL is  up .  Second I downloaded "FieldS of Hope", Lacus Clyne new image song.. it's sooooooooooooo beautiful!!!!! PURE KAWAIINESS!!. Third, ZAFT boys reunion :) :).. the old zafties are back weee!! Fourth and last.. next week I'm gonna host an anime party =D. I'm glad my mother allowed me to do that, at first she was reluctant to accept. Gravitation, Weiss, Sokyuu, SEED and lots of anime =D
1	It's official, I'm going to be going to college next year, in Boston.
1	OMG! My call time is in an hour! I’m so excited about putting on “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”! Even though I’m an usher, I’m still expecting to have a blast!  I need to get changed, eat something (crap!), and get my butt out of Brown, and get to McDonough! My dad’s training better be over soon, damnit!  Off to do what needs to be done! -Nancy

0	And perhaps only slightly less depressing is the trailer for the impending  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  movie, which can be seen via the link provided.   This is going to be even worse that the Lord of the Rings catastrophe, and probably twice as popular.
1	So I shall be in Washington D.C. from tomorrow night to Monday night.  And yes, I will be out of e-mail contact. I know, blasphemy.  Call me on my cell if you need me.  I'm so excited that i get to see Spencer and all my summer friends again.  =)  Though I still can't believe I'm heading off to another Congress, at least I don't have to plan this one so I can be just like all the people I yelled at last weekend.  And there are no frogs outside my window tonight!  And tomorrow is a late start day!
1	I've found a place which looks promising, trying to arrange an inspection at the moment. It was close to my price limit but they dropped the asking price by $15,000 yesterday which makes it much more affordable. Apparently has been on the market for a while, so I might even be able to go for $5k or $10k under that.  Of course that prompts the question of what's wrong with it... sounds like several buyers have been turned off by having another apartment upstairs which can look down into the backyard. I'm probably okay with that. Also when it was first on the market there were tenants still leasing, not sure what the situation is currently (but there was no mention of anything in the ad).  The size seems decent, and location is great - walking distance to Chadstone shopping centre and (barely) the train station I normally drive to - which should save me 20 minutes getting to work.
0	I have run out of Top Ramen and am now overwhelmingly depressed.
1	Daisy hasn't been out for ages and she fancied to go to Birmingham with Tiffany and Olivia the other day! She seems to have fun in Birmingham and enjoy every single second! Let's see what she gets on during the trip.   Daisy: Hello everyone I am now in Birmingham!!!!        Daisy: I like fountain I do -^^-        Daisy: This is Tiffany my younger sister        Daisy: Christmas is coming! Can you see the christmas tree behind me        Daisy: Let's walk up stairs together Tiffany!!!  Tiffany: .... I am waiting mammy to carry upstairs....        Daisy: (Smile)        Daisy: Guess what am I sitting on?        Daisy: On a huge rock!!! lol        Daisy: Oh my life! Is she naked?!        Daisy: I am so happy to go out with you Tiffany!  Tiffany: Really? Shall we go to another place then?  Olivia: Don't forget about me!        Daisy: Everybody looks at me!        Daisy: See ya everyone! It is getting darker now as you can see, I'll see you guys soon.

0	Took my dad home from hospital today.  had a cheery morning, saw some friends on the way home. went to see ex when i came back to cambrdige, to ask how she would feel if we tried to put the past behind us and be friends again... decided i needed to do this, for my own sake really, she answered the door and was very polite, but had her new bloke stood behind her giving it large. Lost all nerve and shook, not feeling good at all...... really really down again. :(

Head down that road which is on the right and the place is a big building on the right at the end of the road, it is not a typical building for a church...it's more like a warehouse ......you will see it.  If coming from b'ham then go towards t'town on 59  If coming from t'town then go towards b'ham on 59  There is the directions to the innerchange.

1	For all those who celebrate, a very happy and blessed Easter.  My little family woke to Easter baskets and pastries (coffee for the parents), church and lunch out, a Easter egg hunt later this afternoon (teenagers still love finding money in Easter Eggs) and dinner tonight with my parents.  A lovely day...

1	I &lt;3 Karen's X Character File song (her's and Yuzuriha's.  I hadn't realized it, but I already had Subaru's...Seishirou's is very strange, though).  It's like, teh sex.  woot.
1	   First, the manipulative part: He's so racked with guilt about breaking your heart that he tells you he loves you in order to feel better about himself.  Now, instead of cursing his name, you'll feel bad for the poor, mixed-up guy and tell your friends "Oh stop, hes not a loser. Hes just tortured and confused." Pardon me while I heave. As for the self centered part, let me ask you this: If he loves you so much, why wont he get back together with you? I'm sorry but he doesnt love you. What he loves is controlling you and your emotions.  And as if that werent bad enough, this will really hurt: My guess is that this cad may very well be dropping the L bomb (love) because he wants to keep his options open. In other words, as long as you are still holding on, he has someone-you- on the backburner- you know, just in case he cant find someone better.    Heather, you rock! Thank you :) &lt;3   Btw, todays my moms birthday. And I dont feel like replying anyone! :) 
1	Lesson of the day: When you're watching the television and the programme's on with that Frenchman who makes all kinds of fancy things and he warns you to be careful when you're trying it at home because the sugar is very hot, but you don't pay attention because who  would  do that at home? You really should have paid attention because some day you'll find yourself bored enough to try to make sugar-glass.  I want to have a programme on the television and make pretty useless desserts. I could affect a French accent and everything.  My right hand is all burnt, and I had a really nice painkilling potion and I really should do something about the actual burn but right now I don't care very much because the potion is kicking in, I think. I tried to charm the burn but then I dropped my wand and then it was really  really  funny.  There was something else I was supposed to do today. But I forgot what it was.
0	I've been spending a bit since my last entry; new shoes, rainbow brite bag, some nail varnish& stretch magic etc. I'm still coveting the space hoppper in Lakeland. Although I have a job interview tomorrow so maybe I can make up for it. Its for a woman who sells plus size clothes online from her house/garage. I'm hoping she'll see thesize of my ass and think 'she's the one'. If so, it will be just in time because the job centre are making me have some 13 week review next week.
1	      sausville    and I did  this  (the first one listed under "Regular Trips") today. We are very exhausted and slightly sunburned now, but we had a terrific time. I walked all the way out on the bowsprit while we were sailing back to Willemstad!

1	Hi, my name is Ryan Hague. I'm a proud evangelical Christian, and an even prouder Republican. Jesus Christ is my best friend! My favorite hobbies include shaming those damned homosexuals, protesting abortion clinics, and telling other people how to live! I really enjoy being around my ultra-religious family. I love them all! I LOOVVEEE contemporary Christian Rock! I'm also a huge fan of the FCC, though they could be a little more strict. I love Jesus!    =p  Kidding, if you can't tell.
0	Ok, this Intercal compiler was a really, spectacularly bad idea. I totally overstepped my abilities.   I'm really seriously thinking of dropping the course. Leaving me with two 500-levels to pick up in the fall, but that's only a minor change of plans. Also taking a hit to my academic transcript, but meh. Also leaving me with no idea what to do for a Master's thesis, since this move will likely pretty irretrievably burn my bridges with Dr. Aycock.  Damn I suk.     MPhobia: You'd probably like this music.
0	Today kinda sucked.....went to school.....went to health occ.....washed some nasty things, went to school, got nick, hung out, found out that my friend got accepted to SIUE and we are going to be roomates! so thats kinda exciting!!! Then i went and got heather( who I love love love dearly) went to jazz band....i didnt have my music so it was pointless that i went....went to a gay ass school board meeting with amanda  and amy for our government class, then went to mcdonalds to eat some Ice cream and found another love of my life there, Lindsey!! sat there for a while and then came home and nick was still here so i took him home and now im debating on if i should take a shower or not......thats all for now..... K.J.
1	Things have been absolutely lovely this week. Nothing like getting laid on regular basis to brighten your outlook on life.  Gary and I have been working on getting the apartment picked up, the funeral and being sick caused it to be a disaster area.  Gary has been a godsend, he has done more than his share of cleaning and the house looks amazing. We've been also updating things. I recently got a new down comforter, if I had know it would make me this happy I would have gotten one years ago! We are looking into a new couch as well, when Ikea opens this summer in Atlanta.    We also welcomed two new furry kids into our home.  Chinchillas named Socrates and Plato.  I was only going to get one, but Gary insisted we get both so they wouldn't be lonely. This is also how I ended up with four guinea pigs instead of two, but hey the more the merrier right?!

1	Well, I'm finally going to be taking formal ukulele lessons!  I'm very excited, I really have a hard time teaching myself to do things, and benefit from formal instruction.  I've never taken music lessons before, though, so I'm a little nervous :x  What should I try to teach myself before I go in so I don't look stupid?    I'll be taking lessons from the Halifax Folklore Centre with Mike MacNeil.  Anybody know (of) him?  He's the only one at the Centre who teaches ukulele, according to the brochure.  (Since I'm in Halifax, I thought about looking up Chalmers Doane for lessons, but somehow, I didn't think that'd work out, LOL)
1	      Sometime during the morning, I felt the bed shake. It was Kamui and Chocobo.  --      kush         Yes, I'm putting this journal under friends lock for varying reasons!  Anyway, the people already friended shouldn't be affected much, but if you're a newcomer and want to friend, by all means please do it!  This actually isn't meant to keep out anyone on livejournal :)  So friend and I'll most likely friend back.  Yay.  Er...yeah.  Yay.
1	Update about this guy. Looks like he is Sir Ian McKellan boyfriend. Name as I heard is  Crumpet  And the two of them got the sceen of the night, when the camera gave a close up, about the two, when Crumpet hat his hand on Ian's knee  Update ?ber diesen Kerl Scheint als sei dies dieser mysteri?se Geliebte von Sir Ian McKellan, ?ber den es ja diese RPS Diskussion gab, in den letzten Tagen. Jedenfalls sollten die beiden eine Auszeichnung f?r die Szene der Verleihung bekommen, gab es doch tats?chlich eine Nahaufnahme, wo Crumpet (Name des Langhaarigen) seine Hand auf McKellans Knie hatte
1	well I'm looking forward to school startin again just cause I'm lookin forward to seeing all the people again but as much as I am looking forward to it starting I want it to be summer still too. I hope this year brings alot of things I have been looking forward to and just be a great year. aight well I am extreamly bored so I think I'm just gonna stop talkin so lata  - J -
1	PISTONS ARE THE BOMBDIGGITY  everything is well   im, making money and hanging out summer is fun already   birthday in 14 days hell yeah  Eric
0	Tonight, I am sad, angry, hurt, pitiful, scared, depressed.  Tommorow I will treat this as an opportunity for something better to happen. As far as I can remember, every really big change, unforeseen or not, has led to something good, which is why, right now, I have a good life. There's no reason to doubt that this trend is continuing.  Tomorrow, I will be more optimistic.
0	was the message I just got from       jes6ica    but when I ran out from my office to bask in the glory of the  scrawny fruit delivery boy  and his piercing blue eyes, or at least drool in his footprints, everything fell down.  Fruit guy was a fruit girl.  Poor Jessica only caught a glimpse of the basket, so she naturally assumed that he had come back, and instead the friut company sent us a girl. Harumph. Bah, humbug!
0	I just got sad all of the sudden. In my seemingly neverending search for either new friends or just maybe that special someone. Talking to this guy from the next town (Jackson) trying to make conversation..... it just didn't happen..... usually I can make conversation about anything. I dunno if the guy was not interested or just making polite conversation.   It seems that every guy thats local that likes me either: I don't like him like that or we are just uncompatible (ex: nothing in common, polar opposites, etc) the only guys I seem to find that I like and they like me live states away.....  Coming to the point.... I'm sick and tired of being lonely. In both aspects; in friendships and my lovelife.... :(   I'm just very unhappy right now.....
1	What an interesting week..glad it's over.  Three day weekends rock.  Beach kegger tonight.  They are always fun.  Unexpected things always tend to happen.  I'm looking forward to seeing how this evening rolls out.  Pat is going to try to come.  I hope he does.  I swear, everytime i try to be alone..without a guy.. someone always walks in my life..when i'm least expecting it. Oh well...cute boys who play the guitar, giving me attention..who could complain about that!
1	Ok this is my first journal entry, so itll take me a while to get used to it. I dunno if its "cool" for dudes to have a live journal, but i assure you im not gay. Right now im just chillin with my man calvin, talkin to people on aim. So yeh this is it for my first journal entry, peace!
0	i went to my host brother's basketball game at Mariner... we walked pass the bus ramp so i pointed where my bus used to be, my host mom was laughing.   oh,well i miss going to school. i gave my dog ices in her water bowl because i thought she likes cold water but she just played with it ...ices are everywhere so i have to cleaned her mess obviously.  "White Chicks" tomorrow Beach on Friday... i want all you guys to come before it too late to hang out with me but never mind if you don't care.

0	I just looked on the internet to find some pictures of my university town. They had some 3D animated ones where you get an overview. I was hoping it would make me feel better but it only made me sader. It so want to be there now. It was such a beautiful place to live...
0	i hate greece. its gay and boring. i wish i lived in nyc. theres always something to do there. i wish i could drive with people in my car. i wish cigarettes didn't cause cancer. i wish i was 21. i wish i was never tired. i wish money grew in my backyard. im sick of my mom pressuring me to work so much when all i want to do is enjoy my senior year. i wish we didnt fight. i wish i was happy right now. i wish you were happy right now. i wish i could make you happy. i wish we could just forget about the fights and be happy. i wish you could see how great of a person you are. i wish you knew how much i care. i wish it didnt hurt so much inside. i wish i could stop crying. i wish all my wishes could come true.
0	yes.. it does.&nbsp; I still have feelings for my ex and we broke up NINE FREAKING MONTHS AGO  gawd.. It has me all feeling depressed right now *sigh*
1	I'm starting to get pretty excited about the World Hockey Association in Dallas.     http://www.worldhockeyassociation.net/n ews/recent_news/recent_061104-5.htm   Our draft selection was okay but I think we could have selected some better players.  Here's the "star" list that we got:  Eric Lindros Scott Gomez Kip Miller Steve Kelly Blake Sloan
0	Well as of day 13 I decided to say fuck it in regards to sarah...its been 3 days since Mike droped off the flowers and letter and still no reply and mike is saying he cant find her or reach her...BULLSHIT people dont just disappear like that.  He even claims to have called her mom last night at 930 at night and there was no answer!! What kind of mother with a kid isnt home at 930 or 3 days in a row when hes supposedly gone over to check on sarah...Im guessing he decided to read the letter and then not bring it over...I really dont trust mike hes been a dick way too many times and I wouldnt put it past him to just lie about everything.  So to the world at large I am single and very lonely but I will live.  ttyl

1	She said yes!  Ting and I are engaged! The sweetest, smartest woman alive said  yes . She wants to marry me. I've never been happier in my life.  I've almost enough money saved and hopefully I can buy a house for us... maybe Dagny and everyone can visit. The future never looked brighter.
0	Kinda wanna go to the show today, but i dont have a ride....
1	Well, Saturday's date was fun.  The Wookey took us up to Albq, which was really nice of him.  The idea of a double date died with the lack of another couple though.  Nikki and I ate at this cool Tai place right by the movie theator.  They had great curry.  I got an awesome quote from Nikki that I thought she'd never say: "Mmm.  Tentacley goodness."  We then saw 'Ghost in the Shell II' which is an awesome movie.  I can't decide if I like it better than the first, but this one is very quote heavy, more so than the first.  Anyway, I suppose I should get to Discrete and do some drawing or something.  Oh, and I must make a puplic display of my apreciation of The Wookey.  Without him, the wonderful evening would never have happened.  -Bobda 0ut! :)
0	It seems that this morning I got online to check my email and this is what I found written in my stepmother's offline message:  how does it make u feel when u try your best to help someone but then they use u and stab u in the back just one more time..do u think u would eventually learn....WELL, I FINALLY HAVE!  Hopefully one day she will grow up and realize that I didn't stab her in the back.  It hurt my feelings for her to do me that way when I had been out of work for 6 weeks with no pay but o well.  I guess that's just life, and no matter what you do you are always going to piss someone off.
1	    Where can i start?? Hmm,putting last friday's auction and trivia night aside.....SATURDAY was loads of fun!!  Karaoke had it's moments, but overall it was quite a deafening yet enjoyable experience. =) Teppenyaki!! OMG , it was the first time i've eva been and i must say, i wanna go again!! Next time though, i want to try a posh one just to see the difference. ^_^    Looking forward to the screening this friday and the soccer match!!....
0	Hey. I'm Kristen. I'm 15 and I'm completely obsessed with Anne Rice, the chronicles, the movie&nbsp;Queen of the Damned, the soundtrack to QOTD,&nbsp;and Lestat. I'm really into vampires. I'm in a coven called Satan's Nite Out. So yea...I really don't know what else I should say. I guess I'll be leaving now. Bye...
1	Idiot quote of the day:  "Isn't the United States a country?"  Also,       pucchy_chicobo   ! What is the website with all your adorable Yazoo pictures!? I wanna see them again, but I don't remember what the URL is! I wanna look at how you draw Yazoo's hands in the picture with him dancing. No, dancing is the wrong word. Being cute with music. Yes. Something like that. ^_^!
0	its been a while for sure so yeah nothing has really changed but some situations have gotten better and some ugh... i try not to think about this should explain most of it.

1	Two shows in less than a week.. i am all kinds of social and my right hand is all x'd out... the vfw was my space central tonight...  i actually had a really good time considering it was a show and all and generally i sit there feeling all out of place and uncomfortable but Passions was more awesome then all that is awesome at once and sometime during the night i got that overwhelming "everything is gonna be just fine" feeling and i couldnt stop smiling and god i love that feeling...  There's nothing greater, its a fact...  Plus nicole busted me talking to the computer about broccoli at work.......im one hundred percent, regular. i swear.   Life is too short for music that sucks.  ...Lets jam.

1	I'm BACK BIATCHES!  EFF YEA!  Yea...actually I've been back for two days, but meh.  It doesnt make me any less back.  Umm...well I hung out with the fam on Friday, then I hung out with Nate, Gretch, and Cindy.  And Friday night I slept on my wonderful bed...Oh my goodness I almost died from satisfaction overload...  Saturday I woke up bright-n-early at 1:30 in the afternoon (my excuse being I was still on NM time), and I went out to eat with Mikey and my mom.  Then Amanda and Uvaldo picked me up in a random McDonald's parking lot and we did fun stuff.  Good times...good times...  And, I partly cleaned my house.  I'm sick of it being icky, so I decided to do something about that.  You all know I dont clean.  WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO ME?!?!?
1	Can't wait to see you all !!  A number of people have asked how they should dress.  Howsoever you want!!  Probably not nude - it IS still winter - but anything else is just fine!  Just come ready to laugh, and maybe bring a munchie or a drinkie to share.  Wheeee!!

0	you have no idea how badly i want to do....just once....just one time...just for those few moments were my life isnt pain
0	      The Badgers played tough.  But... just wasn't enough.  That long-three play they tried late in the game was horrible, though.  Should have driven that one in, or at least SET themselves before throwing it up there (because, really, that's all he did... may as well have shot it from half-court).  To be honest, I wasn't expecting a win today, but they played better than I was thinking they would, and the game was much tighter than I was anticipating.    I'm wearing my Badgers stuff to school Tuesday with pride.  We definitely didn't embarass ourselves today.  :(  
1	This was just TOO cute not to show it to you:  Found on  B3ta .&nbsp; Adored by all.   mofaha.com  WHAT A CUTE KITTEH!
1	Went to the EB at the Sunrise mall with my friend Drew today and picked up a few Dreamcast goodies. Most EB's don't carry  any  Dreamcast games/accessories at all now-a-days, so I was happy to find a brand new 4x VMU for 1.99, a regular VMU for .99, Soul Caliber for 9.99 and Shenmue for 3.99!  Sadly, I have been a Dreamcast owner for several years, but didn't own either of those AMAZING games. Oh, I've played them both, don't get me wrong, but now they're in my collection :) Woot for me!
0	  just when i thought things  couldnt get any worse...they did.  this week has been hell. i  hate it all right now. i wish things could go back to how they used be when we were all happy &amp; worry free. i guess those were the good ol' days when people were actually real &amp; didnt try so hard to be something they werent. if only wishes could come true then maybe id be ok.  not so much love. bea.  
1	I didn't want this post to be in my angry Alice one...  Preliminary Brigadoon auditions are this Saturday and Monday. I'm very excited. Although I have been behind the audition table before, this feels very different, and much more exciting to me.   So, audition for Brigadoon if you're in the area, and if you're good. (Well, what? Did you expect me to NOT want good people?)
0	So there I am quietly waiting to use one of the cash machines during my lunch time, in the middle of the queue of about 15 people. Then a young person decides that queuing is for mugs and in a "subtle" trick casually chats to his "friend" who is using the machine and then proceeds to use the machine himself. And so I challenge the scoundrel saying "OI! what do you think you are doing?" nothing "YES YOU, the one who jumped the queue!" nothing "OI!" "What's your problem?" "You, you should have waited, why should we wait if you won't?" "So what's up your ass?" etc. etc. etc. well.... it culminated in my assertion that the person in question was an "ignorant c*nt" and his "friend" holding him back as the slagging match headed toward violence.  In some ways I'm oddly upset that it didn't get violent. Strange.
1	My goodness, this weekend has been the best I've had. It started off on Friday, when me and Sandy celebrated one year by going out to Vito's. Saturday we did nothing. Sunday, though, we went to IOA (Islands of Adventure). This was the best time I have had in a theme park. We first went to Jurassic Park, but she got scared and ruined the picture.  &gt;:O  Oh well. Later on, we went on Dueling Dragons. We ate afterwards, and then we used 10 dollars on some stupid "carnival" games, and we ended up winning NOTHING. Anyway, afterwards, we went to Universal Studios, and we went on one of the coolest rides out there, Revenge of The Mummy. All I gotta say is KICK ASS ride. That is one of the best rides out there. I highly recommend it. Anyway, we had a great day today, and it's all thanks to her. I love that girl with my life. Muahz. Love ya babay.
1	Booked my tickets  homethis morning.  I fly out on the 20th June and land in cape Town on the 21st oh-yeah! Can't wait!
1	I have released an initial version of the  XAB Toolkit . The XAB Toolkit is a tool to automate the building of Ajax type applications on Mozilla. It can take a MySQL Database definition and create an application around that. The application uses an XML data model to allow the user to define application rules including validation, labels  and foreign keys.   Using the Data model XAB can construct about 75% of the PHP and Javascript code to build a database enabled application.   Download  The XAB Toolkit   View the  XAB Wiki .    This was previously called “xulbuilder” in some posts.

1	Back home again. I spent the first three days I was back helping Stephen and his family move, it was a big, big move; a six person household. More than a dozen truck and trailer loads. I am out looking for a job today and Stephen is working. We have not been apart since I got home. It is sweet, he missed me so much when I was gone, I missed him too. I took him lunch today at work and he kissed me, which is significant because he normally does not kiss me when he at work. No more stalling off to look for a job.
1	ah... i'm so happy! i found a very great link, a nice drawing, and my mum want to buy me the whole episodes of endless love vcd! yay!

1	Last March, my dad turned 70.  What do you get someone that has had a satisfying, fun-filled life that is special?  Well, we decided to get him the Richard Petty Driving Experience.  He did it last weekend while we were all in Orlando.  It was 8 laps around the Disney World Speedway with an instructer in front of him!  It was sooo cool and he just loved it!  Now we are all wanting to do it, although Brent and I would rather do it at a track a little more challenging....like DAYTONA!!!  Unfortunately, Dad had to drive the number 24, Jeff Gordon car.  Anyone who knows this family knows how we feel about Jeff Gordon!  Dad said that you cant see the number from the inside so he was ok with it!!!  It was a highly recommended experience for anyone who loves NASCAR!
1	So I'm back in Indy. I'm not sure I feel like going into details of the adventure back home right now. I watched most of the NCAA champ game yesterday and it wasn't fun. Oklahoma got trounced and Marcus at work kept telling me that Leinert was still scoring touchdowns. The only great part was after the terrible halftime show with overrated Kelly "I was created" Clarkson and Ashlee "I can't sing to save my life" Simpson. After Jessica's pain in the ass sister finished the crowd made the appropriate statement and started booing her. I couldn't belive that there were so many fellow Ashlee haters besides me. Twas comforting.
1	So I finished all the clouds on the cabinet for Dommie's room  Because of the rain lately we haven't gotten to put the final clear coat on the bench or start on the dresser yet, both are going to be pretty nice once finished though.  Then all we have left I think is to buy some hooks to hang pictures on the walls and the nursery will be almost completely finished.    We still need a lot of the room set we want for it though.  You can check out how adorable the room set is at target.com the registry name is under John or Tiffany Berman.    Also for any parents out there if you want to do me the favor of looking over the registry and letting me know if there is anything on there that I really won't need or anything that I will need that isn't on there let me know.  Thanks in advance for anyone that does this I would really appreciate it as I am just going on guesses as to what we actually need.

0	Today is the day I have been dreading for the past month sicne the accident, Jordin's 19th birthday. I have been sincerely crying since I realized what day it was. I got up this morning like it was a normal day and didn't actually realize it was this day until around 1 PM when I talked to my friend Doug. After that, I have been feeling horrible. I did get to talk to my exboyfriend James today which was definately weird cuz of the fact that i was in love with him for a long time. Shawn tried to make me feel better, and it worked for a lil while. So now I am talking to Craig who is doing a good job so far.

1	I just got a call from Wells Fargo.  The loan for the condo has been  APPROVED!!   ^_^  Just gotta get a few minutae taken care of, such as insurance, and the FoxBox will be open for business. ^_^  In other condo news, I'll be going there again Thursday afternoon to take extensive measurements, so I know how much space I have to work with when looking at furnishings. -Nih  ps: Yes wolfie, this means you can get your hopes up a few more notches.  About 5, I'd say. ^_^
1	I would've had the perfect Trifecta had I chose zazzman or whatever that horse was called. I made 3 seperate trifecta bets on vinnie roe and diva in each + then another 3 horses; pacific dancer, she's archie and elvstroem. Damn it! Uh well! Was a great day of drunken foolery! 2 out of 3 ain't that bad.   It's my birthday in 9 days and I have no idea what to do. How boring. I think I'll just do the usual thang with my posse & Co.  Looking forward to:    Working at Homebake this year. FREE ticket and VIP access! :)  Going to QLD for 2 weeks, Nov 24th.  Going to Byron Bay + Surfers Paradise for NYE with the posse & Co.     
1	       Your Linguistic Profile:       80% General American English     15% Upper Midwestern     5% Midwestern     0% Dixie     0% Yankee         What Kind of American English Do You Speak?     I was curious what it would say about me. I'm somewhat suprised about the 15% upper midwestern and the 5% midwestern. I've visited Ohio, and Iowa, but not for long enough to pick up an accent. I liked the question about then it's raining and the sun is shining, but they didn't have the answer I wanted.  I'm really excited cause two of my dresses got shipped yesterday. Hopefully they'll get here monday or Tuesday. The best part is that it's the two strapless ones, which are the ones I want the most!  My friends page is being stupid and the entries are out of order and funny colored and stuff isn't showing up. It's really bugging me, but maybe it will fix itself.

0	It seems Beaudalaire has had a change of heart and really dispises her new digs. She has bit kevin once, and last night hissed at me. I really don't have enough handling experience to turn her around and frankly, I'm at a bit of a loss. Where we are sitting now is we both have aquired a small fear of her new found attitude and can't seem to get passed that. Knowing that she can strike the distance of her body really doesnt help me at the moment. I suppose I should focus more on the fact that she is not venemous so if she bites, it's only going to hurt. I just don't want to experience that. I really hope she comes around.
1	…and if that doesn’t get your attention, I don’t know what will *g*  Another little project I started in the summer and only finished a few weeks ago. I wanted to practice some really basic sewing stuff, and decided I could make some little doll thingies. So here we have little! Pirate and little! Ninja dollies for your amusement. Any resemblance of the pirate to Jack Sparrow is purely  intentional  coincidental  His hair was a pain. Rather fiddly         You can't really see from the pic but he also has several individual dreadlocks sewn in.                ^_^
0	I love my bird. So very much. I love her soft gray feathers, her cute little face markings and her striped tail. Most of all, I love her song. So cheerful and carefree...how I will miss it. She was silent today. The last sound I heard from her was last night as I watched the news, she meeped a few times. I said goodnight to her and went to bed. Today she was hardly breathing. I put her in her nest where I think she'd be happiest.   Dear God,  Watch over Meep as she flies to you. Make the wind to speed her along, and guide her in safe skies until she rests safely at home with you.   I'll see you later, Meep. Sing well for Him as you sang so well for me.   Rest In Peace, Meep: March 01? 2001-December 12, 2003  http://www.geocities.com/gravis187/m eep.jpg 
0	I was going to write something here, but sometimes I've just run out of things to say, or don't know how to say them.  Sometimes, you hear something...sometimes something happens to someone close to you...and it just entirely makes you lose faith in...well...everything; people mainly.  And, for once, I'm not entirely talking about myself.  Not entirely.  And, typically - even when depressed - I sort of have an idea of what to do, where to go next, what plans to make, what move next...and now, I just don't.  I'm along for the ride.    Or, as my Big Daddy would say:  "Let's saddle this bitch up and see how long it takes to kill us."  I'd say "cheers, mates," but, at the moment, I'd rather say, "bugger off, tosser."  So...yeah.
0	*browses through Caranthire's library*  *comes upon the  Narn i Hîn Húrin *  *reads*  *goes pale as some of the memories come back to her*   Dear Eru, I'm younger than my children now... and they've made their own lives here....  I can't let them know. 
1	Monday- I went home after first period. Then spent the rest of the day reading.  Tuesday- School...*shrug* Nothing exciting. Same for work.  Today- Mrs Kennedy brought me books because I am bookless. Yay for tuna at lunch, and for me ALMOST making Lauren spit her water out by making her laugh too hard. I really enjoy Kristen's new chucks.  Patrick came over around 5. We ate dinner, went to the mall and Brusters, and then cuddled for awhile. &lt;3   Only a day and a half until the beach...until then, it's diner tomorrow morning with Kristen, then a half day of school (and lunch with Patrick for the first time this year!), then work...
1	Dear Journal,  Well, I'm back online at last. About 2 weeks ago my internet went down, our next door neighbour was sharing internet out to the entire floor via network, however he moved away suddenly. I finally found the time to set up internet at home today, and now have 2 weeks worth of anime downloads to catch up on.  School is going well. I'm right now taking classes in 'character design' and flash animation'.  Well that's a rough summary of the latest events of particular importance.
0	I really really really don't understand people sometimes...even my best friend.  Sure, everyone is busy at times...but if you truly care about someone and you knew how much something meant to someone, would you do it?  A simple phone call.  I'm not asking 20 minutes, 10 minutes, or even 5 minutes...just enough to know what's going on in your life.    It seems like the only time that i can ever really talk to you is if there is a problem either of us is having.  What's so hard about calling and letting me know what's been going on w/ your day or what your plans are? and vice versa.    I guess what's really bothering me is that in this time when i really need you (when i'm void of showing emotion), i can't get you.  And knowing that you have all these new friends that just popped up out of nowhere, it's like, who am i now?  I don't feel like i'm anyone to you as of lately.    But trust me when i say, "I Love You" and i'll always be here when you need me.
0	and im drunk again.  that didnt take long.  but im also beginning to realize drinking is the least of my problems...  i feel sick...
1	  You are Zoe. While most others see you as a stone-cold bitch and yes.woman to the captain, you can be both a loving wife and quite emotional - though you never let it show.      Which Firefly character are you?     brought to you by  Quizilla  
0	I understand that the TV chief folkees are trying to reverse the obesity trend, particularly in the young. This is good, and I see the reasoning for it and so on.  But really,  some things  must be kept sacred. Seeing him devour an apple while getting bits everywhere just won't be as good.  ...Not that I still watch it, of course, I'm talking nostalgia/cynicism here.

0	i just found out today that gaucha (my poodle) is sick. it has something to do with the liver. the vet told us that she has to be vegetarian from now on. plus she gave us lots of medicine. i just feel so sorry seeing her throw up and now she refuses to eat. im just so scared that i might lose her. i really hope she'll get better soon. i even made a deal with her that as long as she gets better, i will not complain about my work. i just love her so much. i know anyone with dogs would understand how i feel.
1	I haven't been on here in...for a long time. Now that school is finally over, I decided to take a long, needed break. I went camping with the family and we were roughing it. We were gone for about four days. It was nice to be away, but it took forever to catch up on you here. You sure do like to talk a lot.   Last week I had to get my wisdom teeth out. So I was on pain killers for a while and pretty much unconscious. Then my left jaw had bothered me so I went back and found out I had lock jaw. Yeah it wasn't fun. It hurt really bad. I have to go back again.   I finally got a job. I officially start on Wednesday. It will be nice to be making cash again. I'll mostly be working on the weekends so it won't be too terrible.   JC! Ok, first of all I have to say I love the short hair! Maybe he will cut it even shorter someday. I haven't heard his songs yet. Many seem to be raving about them. I'll go looking for them later on tonight.
0	Such a big person...a void that can't be filled. There is only one Hippie Dave. I can't believe you're gone. Jim Bean in one hand and a bowl in the other..always willing to pass and share. Never a complainer, a huge bullshitter, and a talker of the largest proportions. I loved you, you were a good-ass person man. I am still stunned. ......oxycotin is evil.
1	  Over the stars....suicidal huh?      What JTHM moment are you?     brought to you by  Quizilla     Today has the possibilty of being REALLY good. *Marie*

Yay!  later ace
1	mmm  so i got rejected from 2 more schools today Kings College London and the University of Warwick (not that i really cared anyway)  so i guess the most interesting thing in my life right now is my upcoming schedule this weekend: state quals next weekend: uh . . . studying?

1	So, I'm in a GREAT mood considering I have to go back to class tomorrow, or rather this afternoon.  I had a good break.  I got caught up on some much needed rest, and, of course I turned 22! :)  I'm guess that's it...glad to be back to my school week routine.
1	Well, we have a sort of website.  It is a temporary holding page (better than the previous under construction page which was just ads for other people).

1	This Saturday, July 3, is Free Comic Book Day.  I'm putting out a zine called Hey, Comics! It's an anthology of short stories from members of a small mailing list I moderate.  These contributors are Arnold & Cynthia Arre, Quark Henares, Chris Costello, Neva Talladen, Harvey Ong, Mark Lavin, Dean Alfar, Jordan Santos, Andrew Drilon & Wincy Ong. It'll be about 64 pages.  It will be FREE only on this ONE DAY. After that, it'll be sold wherever they'll have us. We'll be giving them away at CCHQ, which is at the 3rd floor, FBR Building, Katipunan. Across Ateneo, near World Topps. Supplies will be limited, so try to be early. :)  Please feel free to tell anyone you think would be interested. :)  Some more details at  http://mindfuel.blogspot.com 
1	Riding people (of which there is one, but now I have a place to send otheres when I forget): I finally got my ride time!!! yay I "kick off" my dressage at 9:54 ish.  I'm guessing anywhere from 9:30-10.  I don't know when cross-country is, it all starts with training level at 10:30.   I'm number 19!  Anyway I hope y'all can come, its gonna be a party!  Bring giant spatulas, cause you're gonna have to scrape me off the ground! Or out of the lake, or out of a ditch, or off a mountainside, or down a cliff, or maybe just in the warm-up ring!
0	hopefully the band can get once on this island up to snuff before wednesday. cuz we're pretty sad right now haha. blah. hopefully they'll be time for more intensive guitar practice after the musical, even though that's helping loosen up my hands with all the chords and whatnot. good stuff. should start looking for a job. anybody want guitar lessons? haha. blah.
0	Finally Back to college...After a month of hectic Pratibimb Organization (which were by far the best ,most educational ,productive , and enjoyable days of my stint at VJTI) , and 2 weeks of recuperating .... and is it depressing or what! The atmosphere is class is one of gloom , despair ,boredom ..All thanks to the everyone studying for GRE and CAT , trying to form final year project groups and assign guides.Everyones all worried about GRE scores and project guides and placements and Live and dead KT's .No one even observed the regular Saree day and Rose day or any of those other breaks in monotony .... I miss the carefree first and 2nd Yr days when everyone (i'm leaving out the die-hard nerdies here) happily bunked and lukkha marofied in the quad ..with not a care in the world ..except where to copy the assignments from :P ...Get all nostalgic  when i see the freshies occupying my "corner " of the quadrangle , where i spent my entire first year..Those were the days..sigh...
0	The Cranes Are Flying (Letjat Zhuravli) USSR, 1957  Have bought this video like, two weeks ago, and since then had been resisting the need to watch it. Gave up today. Did watch the movie, weeping all the way along. But even through the teary eyes, couldn't stop admiring cameraman's work... That's what makes me believe that cinema may indeed be called Art. Sometimes.  Also, it rained like real spring rain today -  the first  real spring rain this year.
0	Last night at the dinner party, I started to feel homesick. To be honest, I didn't think that would happen. But the Koshari just brought back all of the wonderful memories that I have of my sister. Even throughout all of the pain and suffering I was involved with growing up, there are still many moments that I am grateful for. I miss Isis. I miss Rishid. Right now I feel almost lost without them.
1	One from the       french_saunders    community and the rest made haphazardly with a painter program that I hate and isn't photoshop or open canvas(my trial period expired which explains why i'm lax in getting the rest of the meme's done)        I'm attempting to have a theme of Disney icons(with a Snupin icon here and there to make me happy)....because....well I'm excited that I'm going to Disney AND Anime Expo at the same time =D  I get to ride the Roger Rabbit ride again! And ride the Buzz Lightyear! AND ALICE!!! AND MATTERHORN!! *nerdgasm*
1	Hey guys. Well, it was an excelent show today, as allways!  Kelly  for a wile there had his mike volume down, that was hillarious, oh, he also had it on mute, lol! Congradulations to Rosie, yahe!
1	The last time I was in Chinatown in San Francisco, I happened to see this guy on the street.  Though his signs had something to do with China, Tibet, Bush, Satan, and the End of the World, he would just shout "HAPPY! HAPPY! HAPPY!" as everyone walked by.         So, imagine my surprise, when I was walking up Telegraph today, and saw him doing his thing near Sproul Plaza, at U.C. Berkeley.             I wonder if he's following me?  I wonder if he thinks I'm following him?
1	I'm EXTREMELY EXCITED about our little intense talking session tomorrow night!  I can't wait!
0	Okay, apparently it is not okay to be racist and think that aborigines aren't people (I dont agree with that statement can I make that bit clear).  But it is okay to loudly proclaim you hate all vegetarians. When asked why, the question in turn is wouldn't you rather a nice juicy steak instead? Noone bar the vegetarians complains then.  No, and you didn't answer my question, bitch.  I dont care if people don't like me, I think they're idiots if they claim to dislike me because I dont eat something they do. Especially if they don't/can't justify it.  Thinking people are idiots makes me sad.   I haven't come across this since I was 15.   (also shiny new Litrix icon)
1	smelling "red cake" baking just for me :)  mmmmmmmm  thank you       erike   !
1	so last night consisted of three hours in the library finishing my stupid french essay, then it was off to a friend's going away party (he's studying abroad spring term). this means that i don't remember a thing past around 11. it was worth it, i had fun. but i do not feel well this morning.  i'm so excited to see everyone again, and go to the beach, and drive.   home in less than 24 hours!
1	I haven't seen a movie since I saw "Catch Me If You Can" back on the 25th of December, which was a movie that I was surprised by and liked very much.  However, tonight I saw "Bowling for Columbine" and it is probably one of the best movies/documentary film that I think I have seen in the past year or two.  If you haven't seen it yet, SEE IT.    It is one of those films that everyone should see which has some actual, real life, meaning to it.  Myself and the other six people that I was with, were moved to tears one minute and laughing our asses off the next.  Truely a great film.  If you get a chance, also read Michael Moore's book "Stupid White Men".  He doesn't claim to have all of the answers, but he brings up some interesting ideas and view points.    Later Friends
1	We have a new friend living in the front yard... a SQUIRREL!!!  Yes, my friends, my favorite creature has finally taken up residence near my house.  The dogs have been going nuts watching this furry ball of joy fearlessly eating out of our bird feeders.    With thanks from Amy for the idea, I have named him Captain Acorn.     And last night I had a blast.. Amy, Idzior, Phil, Dylan, new glasses and DDR.  *sigh*  A very nice night, I have to say.  And now I'm going to go check on the eggs that I will be coloring later for Easter.  Amy's going to come by and help!  Yay!

1	Not pregnant.  I'm really really really really really glad.  If I were, it would be Simon's, and another 'accidental baby' by a father I don't want involved with would not be a good thing.  I would much rather have a baby from an anonymous donor, maybe I'll think about it when I am settled in.  Right now, Alexis and AJ are helping me get the last of my stuff piled into the empty rooms of my new house.  Tristen and I have been using every spare second building him a sandbox.  He wants a treehouse too, but when summer comes, we'll see.  My new store looks beautiful, and I told Alexis she should go into interior design.  It's opening on Friday! Can't wait!

Wie ich alles wiederholen sollte ich, sagen Sie in 3 Sprachen. ¡Conseguí mi pasaporte hoy!!  Me siento tan internacional.  Como debo repetir todo yo diga en 3 idiomas. J'ai obtenu mon passeport aujourd'hui!!  Je me sens si international.  Comme je devrais répéter tout je dites dans 3 langues.

1	Last night was the new sisters first meeting, and our elections, our new e-board looks just snappy, and I'm pretty excited.  I just love Delta Delta and I thought I'd share.
1	Happy Ides of March!  As I am presently struggling through Caesar, it seems rather appropriate to celebrate.  Mom and Dad (and Hilary too) are coming over for dinner tonight.  It's the first time they will actually come to our place in months and months.  I really hope they don't cancel.  Again.  I have two lovely fat pork hocks in the slow cooker right now, simmering.  Bean Soup tonight!  I'm tired, but the headache I woke up with is gone.  Also: I really like it when the apartment is tidyish.
1	I didn't have work today so when I woke up I started playing video games. I haven't gotten to play in such a long time. I forgot how good it feels to sit on my ass and escape reality. I went over to Glenn's house and returned a game I was borrowing. I was going to go to a car auction today, but as I was getting in the car I found out there wasn't one this week. I guess I'll just have to go next week. I went and bought some more video games today. It was a good day to do nothing.
0	it just makes me sad. and i dont know if i should be sad. yknow?   as my mother says ' this time is like a pimple on someones ass somewhere'   i hope so.
0	even though the sun is shinning and the day is beautiful outside there is still somthing missing...the thing that is missing is Carl's laugh lingering over the campus and him standing at his corner..he was a great man whom was like my father...who always new what to say to cheer me up and he always new what to say to freak me out...everything about Carl lies on this campus and the people that go here...he will forever be apart of me when i need him the most, and he will never fade away...  i am havin a ruff day so if you see me just give a hug and that is all i need..i might not be in the mood to really talk to any one...but on that off chance that i need to talk just listen if you could...well i hope everyone enjoys the weather outside...  by the way CHELSEA I LOVE YOU MORE THEN LIFE IT SELF AND YOU ARE THE ONE I WANT TO GROW OLD WITH!!!!

0	[priavte]  There are  rumors  about me and Sirius. About the argument we has in Hogsmeade. He didn't say he hates me. He said we are ruined forever. It's not me that's changed, it him.  And he doens't want me, Ever again!  He said he liked me back when we were first starting 'seeing' each other, but he doesn't now.    Who's going to want me if now not even Sirius does? How is that supposed to make me feel, that not even Sirius Black, I am sure the horniest bloke at Hogwarts, wants me?   [/private]  My picnic with Billy and his little friend Larissa ( an one of her friends)  was put off becuase Larissa had something to do when we were going to go. We haven't set up a new date for it yet but we will I am sure. I hope so becuase I think Billy is the only friend I have left.

1	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I lay in bed, wrapped up in a sheet, unable to get you out of my thoughts.&nbsp; Thinking of the day I'll get to see your face again, dreaming of what will happen between us.&nbsp; A connection we share, being rekindled once more, the physical and emotional.&nbsp; An overwhelming sense of comfort comes over me as I feel your arms around me, and the sound of our laughter is heard only by the two of us.&nbsp; Even the sound of your voice calling me, waking me from sleep, is something precious to me.&nbsp; Why I am unable to rid you of my thoughts is beyond me.&nbsp; Could these be false, child-like feelings I have?&nbsp; Only time will answer that question.&nbsp; Lately, my dreams are of you although you're unaware of this.

1	From today's San Francisco Chronicle:    The Iraqi parliament chose Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani as the country's new interim president Wednesday, reaching out to a long-repressed minority and bringing the country closer to its first democratically elected government in 50 years.  Ousted members of the former regime — including toppled leader Saddam Hussein — were to watch the announcement on televisions in their prison cells, Iraqi officials said. It wasn't clear if they would watch it live or on a tape.    So Saddam has to watch one of his hated enemies, against whose people he committed mass murder, become President of Iraq.  As we used to say way back when, "righteous!"  :)
0	I can't believe that vacation is going to end, and we have to start school tomorrow. What a vacation! It wasn't even 2 weeks. What a waste. I didn't even do anything, except for shopping, what girls do best. My day started off horrible. My back started to hurt, i kept on hitting my leg everywhere, and knowing we have school tomorrow, drove me crazy. The only fun thing i did was watch Garden State and King Arthur. I loved them both. Natalie Portman is my favorite, especially in Closer with Jude Law (hot British actor). Then i felt bad for Narine for she had chemistry homework to do, though she had to work. So, the nice person i am (i am mikey), i finished the packet for her. Damn you Mr. LaRocca. I hated you last year, i hate you this year. Well, the day is going to end, and i will be going to sleep knowing that we have school tomorrow. Why couldn't we have a month vacation off like the college's do. Goodnight everyone! See you All in school
1	i might change my major!!!  it's very exciting :o)  i went to my special ed class tonight & absolutely loved it.  everything was sooo interesting & i want to learn more.  plus my teacher is great...she really loves what she does & well, so does my mom.  i think that this might be the right thing for me.  we'll see mwah~! :p
0	  while everyone's out having fun I'LL BE WORKING!!!!  (bob damnit.. i even requested off a month ago..)      [mumbles]  
0	Hey all...grandpa died on Friday, so I will be gone from Sunday till Wednesday for the funeral. If anyone needs me, leave a message and your call will be answered in the order that it was received.

0	well last week I got some bad news about my job, I need to think of it in a more positive way though... now is when I get to decide if I want to stay in n'albany or not.    I had plans with laura tonight to hit the bars, but they fell through.... I guess it's a night of me in my jammies since none of my other friends around here hit th bars.  I talked to Chuck, he suggested heading up to indy and hanging out at his house tonight (part of the deal is I have to bring my dog to bug his roomates cat) but I don't think my car can handle the trip til after I get the oil changed.    Tomorrow is sorority meeting/ suprise baby shower so I got a gift for her today,  I need to run out in the morning and get wrapping paper.    if anyone wants to do anything tonight call my cell :)
0	I was told in acting class this afternoon that two shows my college was planning next semester ("Chicago" and "Fiddler on the Roof") were being cancelled.  "Chicago" had the rights pulled because of 2 national touring companies, and we probably will not have the finances to back up "Fiddler".    Everyone was upset about it.  However, we can submit suggestions for alternate musicals.    However, we are still planning on doing "Hair", because as Jack told us (and I quote), "The rebel in me wants to raise hell."   I totally agree.   Now I just need to think of a couple shows that I really want my college to perform. ^_^

1	This post is long overdue, but I finally got around to putting up the pile of pictures from all the various trips and adventures that I have had in the last several months.  They are  here .  This includes the Thanksgiving pictures that       burny_md    has been not so subtly hinting that I should post (and I fully agree). There you go Tim.  In other news,       l_stboy    and I are heading to New Mexico this weekend to see a high school friend and I get to do my first skiing of the season.  It seems to have become a tradition of the last several years that I am more than happy to continue, skiing on my birthday! Woo hoo!  I can't wait to hit the slopes.
0	its not good when managing to stay happy for about a week is a big acomplishment, and its even worse when that week is over. im not looking forward to tomorrow, even though theres no reason for that. hmm, lets see, i watched the village earlier tonight and it left me with the feeling that im never getting back the time i waisted watching it, even though i would have just laid in my chair for a few hours instead. the only things that seem to keep me happy are the occasional good day at fencing, and going to the arcade, because in both places i actualy have friends. as always id like to do something this weekend, but chances are i wont. right now im just hoping wednesday goes by fast so i can feel like its almost the weekend. im gonna stop being pathetic and try to sleep.
1	tomorrow is not only St. Patty's! but also BANE!!! fucking hell i'm excited!
1	24 was soooo amazing tonight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ooooh!!!!!!   *is reduced to a blob of gibbering mush, both by anxiety over what will happen next and because Jack Bauer is my secret lover*   Coming soon: My very own homemade 24 icon...
1	i'm moving in less than 18 days and i can't wait, i mean i can count that on fingers and toes. i get to go be with jack, we get to do all sorts of stuff from swing dancing to there is a huuge ska scene there. *dances around*   but alas at the same time i am selling the computer, but i'll still keep in touch with people from home, somehow. i havn't updated in a while, i chopped my hair off, and it is super sexy, you all have to come see it before i leave. umm o and my car died, stupid car but i'll have it back by tomorrow, hopefully...   J.R.S.
1	Life is quite rosey at the moment. But whenever life is rosey theres always the less rosey stuff too.. I'm off to Tunisia in a few weeks... but I have to have 3 injections. I'm transferring office from Bromley to Wimbledon on Monday... but i'm settled at Bromley now and i'm going to miss my chums particularly Eddy and Jane! You have to take the rough with the smooth I guess. So much has happened lately I just don't even get round to updating this journal anymore. Theres too much to tell and so little time! This year is so different from last year. It's weird, but a refreshing change...  I really don't know where to start with this rambleing- on session. So maybe that will do for now. I said i'd post some photos, so heres some random pics chucked in..   Newspaper fight!..      'Jeff- Vince' at Alex's party!..     Wendy looking mean!..     Mexico!..     Costas (the boss!) and Derek (Eddy's Dad!) having a dance!..   
1	I finally found out the plays for next year.  We aren't doing Hair, but there are several other good ones:   Applause/Applause (the audience chooses what we perform!)  The Children's Hour  The Night Thoreau Spent In Jail  Twelfth Night (two versions, one will have reverse gender casting)  Godspell (!) Aida (Yep, the Tim Rice/Elton John musical) various short plays Six Characters in Search of an Author  Three Sisters  Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (we are even planning on selling protest signs in order to raise $$$)  There's another one, but I forgot to write it down (oops).   Next year's season is so cool; I want to be in all of them, but probably will only be in one or two.
1	every one made me feel very happy today. i love my friends. more than i love coke. i do not love kswiss commercials.    ps... wish ya'll could see drunk kira last night!
0	I wish everyone reading this a Happy Thanksgiving.  I met this wonderful person last night. His name is Billy; we talked for hours about everything and anything.  It was nice to talk with someone who isn't always after sex!!! I feel that we could be great friends.  He was a very polite person.  I am sitting here in my room all by myself. I didn't realize that I would be this depressed about not going home for Thanksgiving. It brings saddness to my heart.  I don't really have much to say so I'll write another time soon.  It is fucking snowing, I hate snow.
1	Omg. You cannot believe how excited I am about tomorrow. Me and a huge group of friends with countless hours in DC for the cherry blossom festival. That and my parents are trusting me by myself. The latter fact isn't all that big but it makes me feel special. They're trusting me again. *beams* This is going to be so much fun!   I've been dead to the world for the past two hours. I randomly decided that I needed to sleep as soon as I came home from school. For some odd reason, I didn't feel all that great. Hopefully I didn't catch whatever it is that Daddy has right now. As long as this feverish feeling stays down for today and tomorrow and I don't get sick from standing in the rain, it'll all be okay.  Speaking of Dad, Mom told him about Andrew yesterday when they went out to dinner. He's absolutely okay with everything. Kinda shocking but all good as well.   I still feel pretty damn good. ^_^
1	I just got a email from this contest that i entered with cosmo mag and i just got  intived to AVRIL LAVINGE'S CD RELEASE PARTY ON TUESDAY,MAY 25th! i still can't believe that i won i couldn't believe when i saw that in my e-mail box this afternoon i love avril and i can't believe i get to meet her on tuesday i never thought that this would happen to me  because i never win anything and this just freakin rocks! i'm still in shock hahahaha YEAH!!   -Kate

0	Geeze i hate it when people are raciest!!!

Gosh!!! Every1 just get along!!!!!! Thats all i'm sayin cuz i'm too pissed to talk about anything else. Bye
1	Ren and I just got back from the airport, all went reasonably well! She's fine and, although tired, not nearly as much so as we expected.  Yay! :D
0	Wow.&nbsp; Today I am sucking.&nbsp; I had a bit of energy to try to go and do stuff that would make me feel productive and endorphined, but then it just fizzled.&nbsp; Could blame it on the rain.  Will go watch BBC and feel pathetic now.

1	Okay it's Thursday and Anime Network got another Cromartie high episode!! ^__^ The guys had a tune stuck in their head that they didn't remember the name/lyrics of. XD And so they got the whole school humming that tune. LOL! But, they never figured out what it was. XDD;  Anyway, we're rewatching the second episode and I love in the begining when he is talking about how people complain about animation and voice actors when mangas are turned into animes. "Whoever complains should have to watch this anime 1000 times!" XDD  Anyway, so I should finish school after this. Hehe.   ~OrO~  "5 or 6 guys ganging up on one guy..." "...hey wait there are only 3 or us..." "Don't argue!"   XDDD
1	I had a wonderful time today at the NAPP Photoshop Seminar.   I learned so many new things.  The entire way I function in Photoshop has changed... and so many new doors of creativity have opened.  I also won a book of all the Instructors favorite tips. Nice big 30.00 book. I never win anything!!!     Hopefully I retained all this new information and will be more creative in my work :D I think this may have been the door I was waiting for.
1	Sometimes you plan things out in your mind and you want everything to be, but somehow it all fucks up...well, that didn't happen to me.  I had the best time; the stereotypical senior prom.  I thought everything would go to hell, but it went better than planned.  So i am in love with erin, and why not, she is the sweetest most adorable person i know.  We all looked so hot and beautiful.  John and i still didn't dance together, but i got my film developed already and there is a picture of him and i that came out the best out of all the other pictures.  It's funny that you plan for prom for the longest time and then it goes by so quick it makes your head spin.  We ate at mcdonalds and i think that i shocked people, i looked really nice.  I guess that i could go on forever; too many events and not enough words, but there are some things that are best kept in memory.
0	Okay I have the best friend/roommate.  It is kim's birthday today.  Not only is it her birthday, but it is her 21st, a very important one.  Well she was having a birthday dinner in austin and I was planning on going.  However, I have a major test tomorrow.  And she could tell I was stressing.  And even though she wanted me to be there she still said it was okay to stay home and study!  I feel bad, I really wanted to be there.  I just get in these really stressed moods.  I owe her one big time........
1	so just to warn, some of these aren't the best pics... i was a tad gone.  haha, but that's alright         peoples    me, i don't know, i think will was taking pics    me again... haha, i have the greatest look on my face    joe showed up after he warned us that cops had been called for a noice complaint... ya, sorry, i was being rather loud in the hot tub    peter pan    will    matt and jenna... it totally looks like they were making out, but they weren't.... at least not yet!    i was on the phone with bret, trying to convince him to show up, i didn't even know that boy was in town    allison and katie, i think this is a really cute pic!    jenna and matt  
0	It is Easter, so I shall post an appropo poem by Don Marquis, my favorite poet.   The Nobler Lesson  Christ was of virgin birth, and, being slain, The creedists say, He rose from death again. Oh, futile age-long talk of death and birth!-- His life, that is the one thing wonder-worth; Not how He came, but how He lived on earth. For if gods stoop, and with quaint jugglery Mock nature's laws, how shall that profit thee?-- The nobler lesson is that mortals can Grow godlike through this baffled front of man!
1	Im officially a Timeshare between Onisoft and Fake Beleve. They both want me :S.

0	Today i failed my driving test again. For the 2nd time. I got 3 majors :( but none of them were really serios ones so i thought i'd passed. They were for observation in a turn in the road, observation when changing speed and my emergency stop coz he thought i put the clutch down before the brake which i didn't. Very annoyed. I'm gonna take a big long break from driving now though coz its stressing me out so much. Just found out that Keane are playing at the Albert Hall in April. I'm dying to go but i need to find someone to go with which could take a while and tickets are selling real fast :( dunno what to do. I entered the competition on Virgin radio.... £1.50 to enter! Ate a ton of my credit.
1	I started University. Meh. It should all work out nicely in the end.  The other day i was on my way to the bus stop, and it was beautiful. I looked like autumn. Fall colors are in. Does that mean Christmas is just around the corner? Dear me.  xox. i won at sequence.

1	I get to go to Tsuyoi's tonight!  I have NO IDEA what we're going to do, but it's gonna rock anyway!  I don't get out of the house nearly enough, and my head's been kind of buggy ever since the whole hyperventilating thing.  I get dizzy really easily lately, too.  Oh well.  I'm still going to TSUYOI'S HOUSE!  On another note, does anyone know what I do with the rocks in the Obel Lake sidequest in FF8?  The ones that are all jumbled up and lettered with a mess?  I already read the obelisk and got the Luck-J scroll from Minde Island (that garble/text was SO easy to decode) but I still have these three rocks and nothing to do with them.  And Mister Monkey says I suck.    "This must be Obel Lake."   |Throw a rock | |Try humming  |    |  &gt;Throw a rock  | |Try humming     |   .  .  .  The rock skipped three times.

0	So i have decided that boys suck. Except my cousins. My mom and I went to indy friday to watch their senior recital. It was amazing! I'm so impressed. They sang 6 songs each, and then 3 duets. Danny Boy and Homeward Bound (irish folk songs) made everyone cry. It was so cute to see the grandparents with tears in their eyes. Thats cuz we're all Irish, i suppose. For their last duet, they brought their band onstage and played on of their songs. It was the first time i had seen them perform as a band! They are going places. I got their demo and its amazing how much they have matured since their last recordings. You should check out their website.  http://www.aphonic.com   Pat and Matt are my cousins. ;) Hope everyone else had a good weekend! I must now get down to studying for the impending doom of midterms.

1	Joe's going on a business trip next month, and while he's gone I'm going to PARTY!  I'm going to spend hours at Home Depot, and then paint an accent wall in the living room.  I might drink a couple glasses of wine, eat ice cream, and nap on the couch.  Later, I'll plant bulbs in the flower beds.  The 32 year old me is yelling WOOOOO HOOOOO!!!!  The 22 year old me is yelling IDIOT!  THROW A KEGGER AND BUY A BIG SCREEN T.V.!  The 22 year old me makes the 32 year old me sigh.
1	I'm always amazed how people get bitter. For instance, I was working w/ this guy awhile ago and eventually I decided not to work w/ him, but because of external factors. At first, the person tried to get me back on board, but eventually he gave up. Since giving up, he seems intent on a bitter revenge. Whatever!
1	I cut my finger in sooo many places yesterday at woork. X.x After making my last LJ post at work, I go back and my printer decided to freak out at me and I spent the last hour trying to fix it which I should be finished with it by this morning. X.x And I kept on dropping things...yesterday was a horrible day for me till I left my workplace after work. My bro picked me up and we did some things and then I came home and talked to many great peeps online as I usually do. ^^  I'm not busy this Sunday if anyone wants to do anything with a bloo dragon. Ooh! Also Conjuu? As anything going on today? I can check my LJ at work around 4PM so just leave a comment on where and when to meet you. If its after 6, I prolly won't go. :( Love you all.  *Snugs Alma tightly*

Thank you Aimme for all your support babes *mwah*  Chris and Die I wish you all the best for you both, you know I love you no matter what.

That is so darn cool I can't stand it.  How nice of her to make an English version of her website!  And if you've never visited, Mayu's website is just yummy  Link .  She has two Love Celeb wallpapers up there as well for people who hadn't gotten those yet (They're different from the new ones on the Sho-Comi site ^^).  Edit 3: *goes blind*  The Mayu Shinjo fanlisting is hard on the eyes (text color on that background color wise) x.x  *emails about affiliation anyway* ^^;  I'll make codes to donate/use *nods* ^^;;

0	Well, one of my best friends in the world leaves today for Albania and won't be back for two years. I'm going to try to save up some cash and visit next summer, but of course there's no guarantee that I'll be able to make it. Just feels so strange to have known someone for so long, and suddenly they're just swept away, hell, he's really more of a brother than a friend anyway. And he did say that if he found any vampires or such, that I'd be the first he called to come help. ;)         You scored as  Werewolf .

Cold lager, fish and chips, and the thought of getting home was the only thing that really kept me from going mad*  Ah well... always Monday to win :)  *I wouldn't have actually gone mad, but it would have been close.

0	I do feel like a damn rag doll. I'm tired, and I want something I can't have, and it alternately makes me wistful, and sad, and lonely. I'll try writing for... 6 minutes, before I leave the house. how fantastic. I expect this afternoon will be like pulling teeth, only worse. I'll keep quiet and look cowed during the review session. She wants to send out a letter. I'm not sure whether I should let her do so.   I'm going to write. Maybe I can find a happy ending there.
0	There isn't anything to write.  Just another one of those disillusioned moods.  The 50/50 of Bruce Wayne/John Constantine at its most damaging.  I have nothing I feel good enough about to waste my time with on here.
0	  "And I don't see how you could ever be...anything but mine..."     I have a hard time remembering what it was like without him.     Wow I miss him...

1	My ceramics test was silly.  He told us last week that there would be 15 questions, and he told us what each question would be about.  When he handed out the test, I was appalled that there were 19 questions, and more than four of them were not ones that he told us about.  Was he trying to confuse us?  But despite that, I'm pretty sure I got an A on it.  Even if I didn't know the real answer, I think did a good job of making one up.  I thought he was going to make us work on stuff after the test, but I am so caught up in that class that I don't have anything to work on except sketches for next Tuesday.  So I left way early and sat around until it was time for the recital.  The recital went well.  I didn't make any huge blunders, although I did have trouble with one page turn and almost had a huge blunder.  I had fun though.  OK, gotta go eat!
0	coldplay gives me shivers. wierdness is overthrowing my life. chad...might have diabetes ok super lame and makes me sad.  pray hardcore for him.
1	Saw "A Series of Unfortunate Events" liked very much, it was a good movie. I'm sorta tempted to read the books. Speaking of books the new Anita Blake was on sale so i bought while i was in Boston, so happy. i thought i had to wait till it came ut on paperback cuz hardcovers are expensive, i love after x-mas sales.
0	I don't know why I feel sad today.....I just do. maybe a good walk in the rain will help me figure things out.  Mike
1	Happy Saint Patricks Day! Grab some corned beef, boiled potatoes, and some cabbage! Hope you're all wearing green eh? It's bad luck to not wear green on Saint Patricks day...
1	 so, thanksgiving is 8 days away, and I will have like 20 people at my house for dinner. The nice daughter would stay and help their mom cook, visit with grandma, help set the table, etc. what do i do? I sign up for a race so i can be away from the house all day.    HA! i win!       1. I found three (yes, 3!) of the most wonderful, inky pens in the world. Only other pen-obsessive people will understand this one. 2. I kicked ass on my math test (oh yes, even that tricky #2) 3. Mix it up day = free cake 4. My dad made me a delicious espresso, and somehow his just turn out 100 times beter than mine. 5. Thanksgiving break is so close I can smell it. 6. January 9th (marathon day) is rapidly approaching. 7. Julie's coming home soon. (MAYHEM!) 8. I'm going to compete (alongside kern, blaha, and erhart) in a science bowl against other schools. yessssss. 9. I have an unnatural love for making lists   
1	So, my friend Jamie is trying to rent out her house for next year. I guess she and all her housemates are moving out. Well I told her I want it. The house is cute and less than a mile away from campus. It rox. BUT I need two people to live with me. So who wants to live with me??? The rent is less than $300 a month...you won't find a deal better than that! Well, you might but the place would be nasty. Any takers??
0	You know those funny little "You know you were born in the 80s when" things that go around?  I was always a little offended by the "You've only known one pope" line.  Hey, it's not my fault he's been the pope for so long! (and just for the record, I wasn't born in the 80s)  Of course, for as long as I can even remember, he's been in bad health.  But even these most recent bouts of health related issues have seemed old hat.  So why then, is it such a shock to hear that he was given his Last Rites?  My eyes are all watery and I'm feeling a little uneasy.  It's just... an odd thought when you've never known anything otherwise.
0	well, we made it to state. thats all im sharing about today, everything was good until i got home, then it all went downhill.
0	happy new year, yeah right, same old shits gunna happen next year, nothing new.    id probably be happier if i had friends, or if some people liked me.     i hate myself so much, i need to control this shit better..
0	this sucks....  i just found out the girl i was gonna ask to prom is already going with someone else

1	Thanks Kerri!!! I like it a lot! haha. I think its meant to be there.
1	So, yesterday was Mod Day. Basically my club (ClubRSX) had a meet and it was for modifying your car and we had a huge BBQ. It was awesome.   This is a pic of me and my car. :o)   
0	That song...   I like this song...  But it always makes me feel so... sentimental/reflective...
1	I  just talked to Stephen for about an hour or so. It was really nice. He should be coming here at the beginning of April. It's a shame he's not staying in Jax. I couldn't think of a better treat then to have one of my old best friends back.   I needa take my ass to bed!
1	Aw shucks!  Stephanie and Gayle brought me a Happy St. Patricks day Guiness!  I found a note from my roomy and a bag with a note from those two wonderful ladies in the fridge!  Thanks guys!  That just made my morning!
0	I'm hanging out at Joe's house with him and Shaina and acting more drunk than I am, cause it's fun. Anyway. MES. I hate you, you know who you are. And if you think it's you you're wrong. Because the one I hate can't read this. Maybe I am drunk because I'm rambling, but that's ok I need to ramble. And I need to cry, real soon. And I need to cut, I sooo need to cut. 60 sounds like an even share.
1	oh my goodness! my fiance's iPod came today. i want to give it to him right now!!! i'm going to have such a hard time waiting until the 24th.

I am so sick of trying so hard to be their for everybody and half the time i get brushed of when i am just trying to help....this has been one hell of a week and oh yah i am sick so thats just great.....whatever i give up...
0	have you ever thought about all the years?  looking back its weird to see all the people that i was friends with.  the most ineresting part is that i am one of those people who has never had one of those friend that was from 'when we were in diapers.'  honestly that doesn't bother me.  but i think that is kind of sad that the people i used to be very close with are people that im not really friends with anymore.  i see them around here or there, when im home on break and its so weird to see them and think to myself that i used to be really good friends with him or her.  don't get me wrong in any aspect- the friends i have now are great and i love them so much.  i was just think that some of the people that i am such good friends with now are people that i never would have imagined myself being friends with.  i guess its just interesting and just a little sad....but hey as my brother would say 'eh, such is life.'
1	      nivleklive    is up :) All future updates will be posted there :)
1	Javier got me what I would have never thought of in a million years. I knew it was going to be anime related in some form but I was thinking he was going to get me a wall scroll of either Hellsing or Trigun. Instead he got me a RahXephon book. I didn't even know there was RahXephon stuff out already in the USA the whole series hasn't even been released here yet. This shit is cool just flipping through it I learned a few new things about the anime I didn't know.  So far this is the coolest gift I have gotten in a while. :)  Great now I have to watch the whole series again. ;)  Merry Christmas everyone! :)  EDIT: So today I got Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade from Erick I watched it already. LOL it's really cool I love the art work and the way it's done!  Jin-Roh close-up   Jin-Roh Upper body  pics of one of the Capital Police's Special Units.  Jason got me a Billabong long sleeve shirt and a A Static Lullaby shirt woohoo! :)

1	I just won the bid on this:   http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vi ewItem&item=3880866944   It's an izone polaroid, which takes instant sticker pictures. Fun!! I plan to use it with our guestbook/scrapbook -- guests can have a sticker-photo of themselves accompany their message. So cute!  Now I must start bidding on the film. The not-so-fun part.

0	Today, a busy schedule in my work.   Conversion, a change of material and product.. the first time i meet this conversion in seagate. At first, i wasn't quite aware of it as i had go through daly PM (Preventive Maintanence, so i thought it was suppose to be not much difference.. But it turn out to be some many things we need to watch out for..They arrange me to do with the group of senior staff to learn. But so disappointed that i can't learn much they were so busy to teach me...  So i just learn whatever catch my attention. And they are putting me into night shift to carry out conversion in future.... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh hhhhhhhh......
1	Wow! I definitely haven't updated in a long while. Anyway, let me see. I finally finished my Whitman application last night! YIPEE!! Also, today I went bowling with Kyle and Matt Nation and I definitely bowled a 500 series. I got a 158, 178, and then a 171. For those who don't bowl, that is effing gooooood! Anyway, not much else going on right now. I actually think life is pretty good for once, but don't quote me on that just yet.
0	 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   My CUPE pen just died!!!!  Oh, the humanity!  *sob*   In other news, anyone wanna go to Flip, Toss & Thai for supper tonight?

1	i got a new job! im so happy. the ironic thing is, five star was getting better. but i need the change. at least i will get some more sleep in the mornings not having to take 3 flippin buses to idaho. now i just need to buy some business clothes and heels, and i am all set! the lady im working for seems really nice... i hope thats the case because my first impressions are ALWAYS wrong. and since i always like to pick employers that turn out to be the worst people to work for.... this better be less stressful! less responsibility equals less stress, so i dont have to deal with payroll, AP, AR, or any of that crap any more! it was good getting the experience but now i just have to answer phones and learn how to do some legal secretarial work. (statements of claim, affadavits of record). i hope all goes well to tide me over until i start grant macewan next september! yay yay yay ive been looking for a job for months now! thanks for all your help mom. muah. greatly appreciated.
0	As each day passes I realize more and more how truly alone I am here...how much I wish I could go back and change things, but that's impossible...The past is past, but it just hurts so much...Sometimes I wish I could have gone with them, rather living here...I wish that someone would or something would just come and free me from all of this...but that's probably just a hopeless illusion. I can always dream though can't I?
0	Went back too school yesterday and it has not changed a bit. Too let you know, that is a horrible thing. I think I should have stabbed someome this semester. It sucks already. I fucking hate it.  Heres another quiz     You Are Iced Earth!  The least nerdy band musically, you appeal to metal fans of all types.  You write a decent mix of music based off of other creations, as well as what is important to you.  However, you definitely have an interest in history, and you are at least a nerd of Horror films.  And I don't mean those new and crappy teen slasher films, I mean TRUE horror.  You get along with people of various different types, though, given that you are the least nerdy of the nerd metal bands.      What Nerd Metal Band Are You?     brought to you by  Quizilla  
1	Well, I finally got rid of the final seven longboxes of comics that I had decided to get rid of - I think this makes a total of 14 boxes that I sold off.  I've still got four left. (I originally typed eight, but it was only four.)  I'm thinking I might do little reviews of them as I gather them together and give my thoughts on them.  You've been warned. :)  ---- Edit: Amusing note: I mentioned that I had sold off fourteen boxes of comics, and Rose suggested that it was 'Creeping Adulthood'.  (Actually, she said 'Creeping Adulthood to Maya, who then tried to ask me what it was.  I could understand her, as she was asking me with a cookie in her mouth.)  I replied that I was selling the comics off so I had room to work on my legos.  :)

1	Ahh!     For some scale:    Word to following through on plans. It didn't hurt as much as I thought it would -- everyone probably says that when they get their first tattoo. Some of the more subtle shading should be visible once it heals completely.   YEAH!!!!

0	something seriously wrong is going on with me. i have like...NO energy. NINE, NADA, ZERO!!! its totally rediculous that ihave to skip school because i don't have enough energy to fucking understand what people tell me. And for some STUPID reason, i started stalking someone. Well, the reason isn't stupid, but rather than confronting her like a normal person i just do STUPID things like this. Wait, what? confronting her? HAH, don't make me laugh. Like that ever worked *snort*  now to finish off with some good news. *crickets churp*
1	I can't believe I am done.  I have two papers due later today, and I finished both of them last night.  I started working on them on Tuesday, so I am really happy about being done.  It wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't been getting as much sleep as I had this week.  My running has really been hurt this week.  I am facing a 30 mile week after my 60 miles last week, because my legs are just really tired.  Monday's 6 mile run felt a lot like a 14 or 15 mile run.  Because of the problems, I have only been running about 4 miles a day, and I have been trying to get about 9 hours of sleep a night.  That's tough to do in college.  I am on the mend, and I am planning to have a blast tonight, as my life just got less complicated.  There is a belated Mardi Gras dance party at the German House tonight and Theatre Sports is doing a competition against WSU at midnight tonight.  That should be a lot of fun.  Off to work soon and then class.
1	This week at camp we're making beaded snakes (with the little kids) and solar prints with the older kids.  It's so hard to explain how to do the solar paper, but with a lot of patience, most of them are turning out pretty cool!   The baby gerbils are adorable!  They should open their eyes any day now!  They just look like they're running around with their eyes closed right now.  SO cute!!     I got a guinea pig, thanks to Sara McD!!  Thanks Sara!!  We aren't sure what to name her yet, but here's her picture:        I'll get more pics of the baby gerbils when they open their eyes!!

Mitch we will all love you "allencompassingly, so yeah".   other than that nothing much happened, the pope died, and i did my homework.
0	Well, this may or may not be my last post. I don't have the time, energy, or desire to keep up a journal. I'm sorry to anyone that reads these, if there is anyone. Ending this seems like a endeing sentence in a chapter of my life. Brakchatters, if any of you come here at all...please AIM me at bparis03. I do want to talk to all of you, I really do...  -OUT-

1	Band camp's over! I spent the night at Jaelithe's house last night with some other friends and we stayed up pretty late talking about a bunch of stuff. It's been a while since I've done that, because I didn't really have that many girlfriends that I trusted. It's a nice feeling to have them around. Tommy and I went to a marching band/colorguard bonfire at the beach the other night. It was a lot of fun and the girls on my team liked him. They thought he was hot. That's kinda flattering, when your friends tell you that your boyfriend's hot, and you just think, "Yup, and he's all mine." Argh, I'm tired so I don't know if this entry is gonna be too easy to read. Tommy's picking me up tonight and we're going to the movies, then he's going to drop me off at Jackie's house to spend the night because her birthday party is the next day.  School starts in a week. Ugh.
0	Apart from everything that is crazy..... this past little while has been pretty good. I am almost not afraid to go out with my friends anymore...I have a fear of getting into trouble when I do and its still there but not really.   The store is being renovated...so im outta work and outta money especially after last weekend...  Aparently thow were gonna be paid with our regular pay or our average hours of work and all we need to do is work that time off after so what ever it is ill just subtract an hour from everyday and whula im caught up.

1	This evening was wonderful. Wayne and I talked on the phone for a staggering 2 hours and 37 minutes. Pretty fucking impressive for two kids, err, I mean people, who hate the phone. Anyhow, we went to Micheal's so I could pick up a new sketchbook. I also discovered, to my great delight, that Micheal's carries an array of youth medium-sized shirts. I picked up a black one. It was priced at a very reasonable $2.99. Ex-cellent. After that we went and bummed around in Best Buy. We try walking with our arms around each other, but mostly we just stumble around and trip on our feet. Me likes it, though. ^-^  Well, I'm procrastinating and must be off to start my sketchbook.     I owe Jessie 3 bottles of sparkling cider and a can of whipped cream.
1	Well it seems that i've managed to take a break from this bloggin'  malarky, albeit unintentionally. So much time has passed between my  last update (on the 15th December no less!) and this one, that the mind  boggles. Evidently I cannot possibly seek to fill you all in with the  details, but it ranges from the Chrimbo holidays back in rural suffolk  ,to being reunited with my girlfriend Laura at Uni, to my exams,  through to the start of the new semester. Suffice it to say, its  certainly had its ups and downs, and its unexpected surprises.  Including a departure of ways with someone close to me through  unforeseen circumstances.  But I'm happy, really fecking happy - for the first time in a long  time. I can sit back, and say quite contentedly that everything is  good, and I'm loving it. I've even been able to see the inside of one  of these places:     Scary huh?    More to come.
0	Well this morning I found out about the basketball team. I didn't make it...ehh...oh well life goes on. I'm pretty sure I will make the softball team, I made it last year so hopefully I will this year too. Anywayzz then the rest of the day was eh so-so, but the end of the day..specifically around 4:00 my day sucked. Kayla and I stayed after school because we needed to get our CJSF hours done. Well Kayla's mom has the office call us up to the front of school, and then Donna yelled at Kayla. (Donna is Kayla's mom)..and then kinda yelled at me...Eh I just hate yelling period so I cried a little bit. I know I'm a baby but w/e. So yeah my day was bad. I still haven't talked to Ziggy or Kevin. Maybe I will give them a call later don't know though. So yeah I'm bored and stuff. Byez. Espy
0	I realize that the closer you are to someone, the easier it is for them to disappoint you.  This is probably because we have expectations that are not realistic, or perhaps we gave them more credit than due.  It's sad really.  Yet, there is nothing we can do or say.  We can't tell them not to do it even if we want to, but only that we don't like it.  M, G, S, A, M, E, S, A, S,A, L; these are the first initials of people who have done the same thing and have disappointed me.  My respect for them has gone down, but not too much because I can't expect too much anymore, huh? I can also add another M to the list now. Oh well.  By the way, Happy Valentine's Day.  Sorry for the people who can not be with the ones they love, and God Bless and love for those who do (and those who don't also).
1	i'm still working...    in 5 days, jeremy and i will have been together for 2 months...    i lost 20 pounds...    that is all.
1	Hava ta??t?m y?lanbal?klar?yla doldu, l?tven k???m? ok?a  Well there it is. In Turkish. heh I wonder who the first person to be able to translate that will be :) OK I put up a mystery reward for the first person to translate the above.. and just so you don't have thoughts about the reward, it's not a night alone with me or anything else rather unsavoury. Unless of course you WANT a night alone with me, in which case I suggest you go and see a doctor, immediately. Ciao for now :)
1	OMG it was so warm in here, I had to open a window!  I have window open right now!!!  Hello Spring, come on in!   "Reunited and it feels so good..." is running through my head right now for some reason.  :/  I know... I don't understand myself any better than you do. :p   Ok does anyone else on my flist speak Russian?  Just curious...cause I think that's the only way you would get what I'm saying in the subject.
1	So I'm like in love with someone...And I don't know how to get rid of that feeling...I know he's away and will be back...In April I think...But it keeps bothering me that...All I do is think about him everywhere I go...I know he thinks about me sometimes...He's told me that, but I don't want to be sitting here...Just wondering all the time...I need to find someone soon...I'm going crazy...What should I do...  Also I almost have my whole year already planned out...In May I'm visiting California for the weekend...Just to go to some Theme Park...In June I'm going to NY for the Pride Parade...In July I'm going to NY for the 4th and then from the 16th to the 24th...My friend Amanda and I are going on Vacation...To California...For Thanksgiving I have my father and grandmother coming over...I practically have everything planned out...What is wrong with me I never plan anything...  I gotta go...

1	Well we had our first Bible study. It was real weird at first because we didn't know what to talk about, and no body wanted to talk first, but once we got on a subject we started talking and opened up a good bit. I brought one of my friends with me that's not sure if he's a Christian or not so we told him how to get God in his heart and what all we went through after we became a Christian and we had good discussions, and talked about a lot of stuff. We did all that for like 3 hours. and we had fun. I can't wait until the next one. Were planning on getting some study guides or something like that. But before we do all that we want to get my friend to become a Christian so were all together and on the same page before we start the study guides. If you all have any Ideas on what I could do to make it more interesting or anything. Right now I just need some Ideas on what I could do.
0	hello everyone i did stuff yesterday and today but i dont feal like writing im sad as always   romy  p.s. my new tooth is coming iN!

1	for all the ACLers 04:  Wouldn't it be nice if we were older Then we wouldn't have to wait so long And wouldn't it be nice to live together In the kind of world where we belong  You know its gonna make it that much better When we can say goodnight and stay together  Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up In the morning when the day is new And after having spent the day together Hold each other close the whole night through  Happy times together we've been spending I wish that every kiss was neverending Wouldn't it be nice  Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do We could be married And then we'd be happy  Wouldn't it be nice  You know it seems the more we talk about it It only makes it worse to live without it But lets talk about it Wouldn't it be nice  Good night my baby Sleep tight my baby
0	37-2.  Loss 1: last game of the regular season.  Loss 2: last game of the NCAA tournament.  Tough, tough losses.  Still, they played their hearts out.  Sure, their first half field goal percentage sucked and the points in the paint were nonexistent.  Still my team though, still singing the alma mater.   Go Illini . (Hat tip:       sachmet   .)

1	Just been chatting via email with someone - generally talking about what we think, believe, desire, etc - deep stuff.  Anyway, she sent me this quote after I went on about superficial shite not mattering at all:   "It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing. It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain. It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back."  - Oriah Mountain Dreamer      Never thought it could be done, but that is me in one paragraph! ;)  Makes me feel a part of the universe again.....
0	this weekend was kinda hell and heaven rolled up in one.   Friday, I went to the play it was decent. I went with derrick, amanda, krissy, patrick, and alena. I was kinda disappointed because I thought it was going to be a really good time.   Saturday I woke up early (11:30) to work on homework, I wrote a paper and did a little math. krissy and I went to see the movie "closer", another big disappointment. The story was a decent one but the editing and directing was horrible. They failed to set the mood of the movie, It only had one song that was at the beginning then repeated at the end. It was basically fucked up but in a bad way.   Sunday I woke up early went to krissy's was attacked by her dog. when I say attacked I was bitten and tackled. After that we went to Brianna and Alena's parade party. It was interesting Alena was drunk along with most of the adults. The parade was pretty good I guess. Then we left, I went home and did more homework. I'm didn't finish the homework either.
0	Wow. A lot of things changing lately. I think it's too much for me to handle. I don't want change. I really don't. sigh.   If u see me...give me A hug, or two. I need one where ever i can get it. sigh. I love u guys and i will keep in touch...i promise. And please...don't hesitate to call, IM, or even email me. i mean it. And that means everyone...including my non-WPI friends.  I guess this all means i'm just opening another chapter in my life. But what if i am not ready for the next chapter? What if I want part of this chapter to stay with me? I really have no idea what to say anymore. I think I am babbling. I am just sad and really tired of it all.   I'll post more later. I might even write a poem or two. oh well, back to MQP (THE DEVIL!).
1	ok i was just about to update. and my whole thing just disappeared.  i don't feel like re-typing everything, haha.  i will update later then.   love love love
0	Another week of work is done, I didn't make it home any night before six pm.   It's weird that I see my work and school collegues more than my hubby and kitty's  I miss all three of them when I am away... and yet I continue to add things to my life that keep me away from them more and more   What does that mean? Who knows...

1	As of Saturday morning, November 20, Tom Riddle aka Voldemort has been finally defeated by the Main Order and the Young Order of the Phoenix!!!!!!&nbsp; Harry completed what his late mum started and played the key role in destroying Riddle's magical powers.&nbsp; Riddle is currently a near-muggle and is currently being held in Azkaban.&nbsp; Harry and co. are still a bit sleepy from the after-affects of the final battle, but are extremely happy.&nbsp; Harry slept until one this afternoon, being that he earned the sleep, then woke up and ate leisurely with his friends.&nbsp; It was then discovered that his scar is now gone!&nbsp; Harry's relieved to be rid of the scar for good and all are relieved that the threat of Riddle has been vanquished from Magical London.
0	Woke up at 4:15 because my alarm didn't go off at 3:45 as expected. Thank goodness I had early morning indigestion or I would have slept right through the USA vs. Germany game. Unfortunately Germany won, but it was a good game and the boys in blue had there chances.   General thoughts:  The yellow card on Claudio Reyna during the direct kick was weak.   The number of yellow cards the U.S. received seemed way out of proportion with how they were playing.   Mathis really didn't do much to impress me when he came in.   I would have liked to have seen more of DaMarcus Beasley and less of Mr. Mohawk (see above)   As poorly as Agoos played in the first three games it's too bad we didn't have a young player in his spot gaining experience for the future.   I have a feeling this World Cup is Brazil's to lose now (maybe it always was).   I expect Spain or Korea will be their opponent   
1	     Which Historical Lunatic Are  You ?    From the fecund loins of Rum and Monkey.    I like this test as much as I liked the Druid test, I the enemy. Bwahahahaha  Today has been good though still waiting for call back from Nat, to hear if shes good. Otherwise still waiting to hear of promotion, had great choc pizza with great and wonderful friends. Still have to do Saki upside down on couch watching bad bad DVDs ;) oh and travel the world by food that you eat ie coffee in Cairo, Mocha in Moscow, Lunch in London, Dinner in Dijon and Breakfast in Berlin....  I can honestly say had a spedoikal kind of day if you know what I mean ;). If not well I'm off to build a snowman... Hehehe
0	So I'm driving home tonight listening to the Fun in the Sun 2003 soundtrack, HAPPY OLDIES, when the song Let's Go from the La Bamba soundtrack comes on.  Immediately I remember being a camper at Fun in the Sun, sitting at Thornhill Outdoor Pool listening to that same song.    So here I am 15 years later, on my last day being a counsellor, absolutely devastated that it's over.  I have made the decision that if I am not head Staff next year, I will not be going back to the camp I have called mine for the past 5 years.  With that in mind, I can't help but being really sad.  This was my best summer yet.  I had amazing kids, amazing coworkers, and I made some amazing new friends.  So if this is indeed my last year, it sure was a great one.  I hope everyone else has had as incredible summer as I have, I hate to see it end so soon.

0	I'm v. bored and depressed, but I have been entertained by the memes that follow, so I'm joining in.  Both are swiped from       musesfool   .  First, a music meme.   1. Post the names of 20 musicians. 2. See who can guess which is your favorite song by each. 3. Once someone guesses right, bold that row and include the song.      R.E.M.  Counting Crows - "Omaha", guessed by       arcseed     Ryan Adams Juanes Bacilos Tori Amos Ani DiFranco Richard Shindell Liz Phair Greg Brown Beth Orton  Josh Ritter - "Kathleen", guessed by       poly_phemus     Moxy Fruvous Great Big Sea Duncan Sheik Patty Griffin Eddie From Ohio Guster Dar Williams Matthew Ryan   *whew*  I also had to compile a master list with song titles attached, so I wouldn't be able to waver.  :)  And I managed to make enough work there that I don't feel compelled to do the other meme just now.  Neat, I suppose.  Now, if I could only get rid of this headache...

1	Yesterday's near-impulse buy:       Dual 1.8 Ghz 64 bit G5 Processors 900Mhz Front Side Bus (each CPU) GeForce FX 5200 64 MB 80 GB SATA Disk Superdrive (DVD-R/CD-RW) 256 MB RAM Gigabit Ethernet  I probably should not have bought it, but I've been wanting one for over a year. Time to build my bank account back up. It's a tax write off anyways.  I need to get more memory for it, but holy shizzle this thing flies! I'm gonna run dnetc for a while and see how fast it can crunch.  Quake 3 was getting around 150 FPS at 1280 X 1024 resolution with all the settings all the way up.   Just in time for Doom 3. Prepare to die!

1	Today was another beautiful day. I went out to lunch with my sister. Then I went a read outside in the sun at Starbucks. Awwww...it was nice to just sit there in a sun and read. Very relaxing. I've been into talking to old friends. Getting in touch with the people I don't talk to anymore. It's been nice. They've all been excited to hear from me. Which makes me feel good.  I think I want to go to a day spa one of these days. I've never been. I think it would be nice. Get a facial, massage. Be pampered. Maybe soon.
1	Last Weekend we decided to call into slotcars. It has been ages since we have been. Chris was there so we caught up on all the news. Dallas races slotcars on Friday's. Chris has juniors racing so Dallas races then. That means Karen is down there every week. Apparently not many people talk to her. Which I suppose makes me feel somewhat better. Then it is not me that has the problem it is actually her. It is hard to believe that Dallas is going to be 5 next Friday. I have decided to send him a card. If she gives it to him great, but if she doesn't well that is up to her.  I was merrily driving to work on Friday (singing away to the songs on the radio). Now remember it is dark when I drive to work. Then all of a sudden something hit the windscreen. I shit myself. What the Fuck! I then realised it was water from a sprinkler that was going in the medium strip. Let me tell you I was bright as a button the rest of the way to work.
1	Looks like yesterday's random surfer girl remark has come back to haunt me. My daughter is determined to learn how to surf. She did a Google search and came up with this:  http://www.surfsister.com/ , a surf school that operates out of Vancouver Island.  Now, as luck would have it, she and I are planning a trip to B.C. this summer *and* it'll be her 16th birthday. So, looks like we're going to surf camp. They even have a mother/daughter one.
0	Where are you Christmas  Why can't I find you  Why have you gone away  Where is the laughter  You used to bring me  Why can't I hear music play   My world is changing I'm rearranging Does that mean Christmas changes too  Where are you Christmas Do you remember The one you used to know I'm not the same one See what the time's done Is that why you have let me go  Christmas is here Everywhere, oh Christmas is here If you care, oh  If there is love in your heart and your mind You will feel like Christmas all the time  I feel you Christmas I know I've found you You never fade away The joy of Christmas Stays here inside us Fills each and every heart with love  Where are you Christmas Fills your heart with love

0	I look back on the time we shared. Bittersweet memories come to me. Many things we shared. Many things I miss. Our relationship soured a long time ago. We both still wanted to keep going. We wanted to bring back the love. Neither of us really tried.  I see the fault as mine, Though it takes two to tango. If I could turn back time, I would change many things.  I never will regret our time together. I only regret the time we missed. Nothing can ever change the past. Hopefully the future can mend it.  The love I have for you trancends time. I will always yearn for what I lost. Maybe someday the pain will lessen. But the memory of our love will never fade.
1	COOL!!!!!  So I just talked to Nicole and she said that Deb, Sue, and Alaina are all going to visit her tomorrow afternoon too, so Nicole or Deb is going to organize us so we can all meet up and go there and back together!!!  Which is awesome because, as Nicole said, "It's going to be Maine in Boston, only it's just for a few hours, so we won't get sick of each other!"  EXACTLY!  So Nicole's going to call me back when she hears from everyone, but Deb doesn't get out of work until 10:00pm I guess, so it'll be a little after then.  So I won't get raped on the train on the way home at night because we'll all be together, and I can still get home at a reasonable time because Nicole said Deb would have to be home before too late anyway.  COOL!!!!!

0	ok, lack of brain function while lactating getting really old - this morning I checked to see what time the eclipse was... but come 6:30 did I even think about it? Hell, no. Only when I checked the cnn.com headlines at 10pm did I even remember about it. That pisses me off because I was looking forward to showing Jared what the moon was like on the night he was born (not that I actually saw it then becuase I was kind of busy being in labor). The next one will probably be at 4am or something. Oh, good, actually it's Oct 28, 2004, total at 9:04 local time. That's not too late past his bedtime. Gonna go mark my calendar now  :P
0	just as i thought. i get home from a GREAT show and a GREAT night to find a cd on the counter with sherri's picture on it and a thank you card from the family and this little letter thing. oh my gosh this is the worst. why does this always happen. i mean i didnt loose it when the show i was at tonight was right next door to sherri's work. why is seeing her picture so hard?

1	I found out that at some during my job, I might get to drive one of the UofA carts. WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOO!!! That totally rocks. I also figured that with the money that I'll be making that I could pay rent on apartment up to $450 a month and still live off what was left. How badass is that? Of course I'll be looking for as cheap of an apartment as I cn find because I don't need fancy accomodations. I would prefer utilities included to eliminate hassle and possible included high speed internet. There are tons of apartments around campus that will provide that.   This job is my first big step on forging complete independence, even though I don;t depend on the 'rent for anything right now except if I need to borrow some wheels. I am so psyched.
0	 http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincitie s/entertainment/  *mourns*  That sucks.  I've been a fan of Mitch Hedburg's since the first time I saw him on Comedy Central.  He's probably in my top 10 favorite stand up comedians... it's a bit of a rotating list depending on the routine, but still.  I never got to see a live show of his.  Anyway, I think I got a job at the MSC bookstore.  Pay sucks, but it's very flexible hours, which I appreciate.  "What about the Dufresnes?!"  RIP.  :-(

1	I had a few hours I had to fill up tonight, so with absolutley nothing to do I drove up to Best Buy just to look around.  What did I come across and have to buy, one of the funniest movies of all time, The Fat Boys in   Disorderlies .  Oh man, I cannot wait to watch this DVD.  I know it's not a great movie.  But it's  the Fat Boys  and it's physical comedy.  Does it get any better?
1	So, I've figured out the topic for my "What is I?" project, and that topic is the same as the subject line above.  I'm going to do a telling of my personal story, focusing on issues of logic and illogic, rationality and irrationality, knowledge and personal faith.  I'll do some examination of myself through examining belief structures as crazy as or crazier than mine.  So far, the project is turning out to be a lot of fun.  A few things to point out:  The  Principia Discordia  is the funniest (i.e. best) religious document ever. This  parody  of intelligent design made me laugh. A piece on  disability inspiration .  I'm not sure exactly how to feel about this one.  But perhaps that deserves an entry of it's own, if anyone is interested. Well, that's it for now.

1	Last weekend was       barbarakitten_t   ‘s party KittenCon.  I had a wonderful time.  I have a bunch of photos up on Flickr ( KittenCon2005 tag ) taken while driving, at the party, and of the new house in its “before” state taken during the tour on Sunday.    I saw a little City of Heros being played, and computer games have come a long way since the Z-80 and 64K days when I was last doing much game playing.  The fried ice cream, those who had not tried it agreed, sounded repulsive, but was judged delicious after trying it.  Java the dog is cute.  Cats are sleepy.  It was great to see Gundo, Tess, Gabriel, Xap and Xaplings, and, um, everyone else.  Kitten, Marcey, Charon, TC, and Sean, of course.  Special thanks to Marcey for great food, and to Kitten for being Kitten.
0	Bad day, not in a mood to do anything...  Don't feel like coming home after work, so went to buy some grocey.... bought a cucumber for my tortoises.  When i reach home, after all my daily routine, i went to feed my pet, one of my tortoise found died.  Mood is even more low and foul...
0	Well Miami gave me some financial aid money, but $4,300 isn't really enough to make it comprable to UCSD.  *sigh*  Not that I don't think I'll be happy at UCSD but I was kind of really looking forward to getting out of state and being near w00bies.  So yeah, unless ND comes through with a yes and a huge financial aid package San Diego it is.  Oyyyyyy.  Now it's time for homework before work.
1	     One of our family portraits from 2001 ( view others )      I'm visiting home today, doing laundry and hanging out with my family.  At one point, all of us were in the kitchen. Lauren was making  guacomole, Mom was making some quesadilla's, and I was giving Dad a  massage. Mom had just put on John Fogerty's new album,  Deja Vu All Over Again , and we had all been enjoying it. Then  Honey Do   came on and we all started grooving to it; my mom was dancing around  the kitchen, my sister and I were both dancing in place, and even my  father was bobbing his head in time.      After we sat down to lunch, we were talking like usual, exchanging fun stories and laughter. I told them how Dave and I walked back from the Pub in the rain Friday, totally stoked and soaking wet. My sister told us about her walk back from work one day, when a guy in the elevator thought she was crazy. Laughter abounded on all our stories.    I love my family!
0	Senor died two days ago, but Jossi and myself don't want to believe it. We kind of left him chilling in the room.    I wrote a poem in his honor, and i would like to share it with everyone who reads this...all two of you.  Senor Ding Dong, what a guy, Senor Ding Dong, why'd you have to die? Senor Ding Dong, To heaven you will fly, Senor Ding Dong, You were t3h guy   Sooooo beats Steve's song about Leah. Sukkers. Take that Razor Blade band!  -Sly

1	I just talked to my mom and our airfare and hotel is booked for our trip overseas! We fly to London for six nights and then take the train to Paris for two days and fly home from Paris. We have an apartment to stay in Paris and were trying to get the same thing for London. We leave on May 16th! I am excited!! Now all I have to do is make sure I graduate. :)  Oh, check out the new icon. Ryan Reynolds, yummy!

1	Disclaimer: Not my characters. Characters: Kate, Jack For challenge #2  traditions     When she was a little girl, Kate used to wake up early on Christmas day and sneak down to the living room.  She'd hide the presents, then act innocent when her parents woke up.  That was a lifetime ago.  She's not that innocent little girl anymore, and she's long since stopped believing in fairytales.  This Christmas she wakes up early and sneaks into Jack's cave.  She places the mango next to his head and tiptoes out.  It's not much in the way of a present, but she wants him to know she cares.  Merry Christmas, Jack, she thinks, and smiles.
1	 Peter Serafinowicz and Robert Popper are the new Fry and Laurie .  And     My mother brought them back for me from Melbourne, and I love them, so shaddup.   
1	I'm really happy for some reason and it's weird cuz i'm not usually happy. Maybe it's because i'm listening to happy music. Ehh anyways i am kind of sad because phantom of the opera is playing no where near me anymore. The closest theater is like an hour away. So I have to wait till the dvd comes out May 5th which isn't for awhile. I have no plans today and none of my IRL friends are online, i probably should get out of the house though. today for some reason I felt a longing for my clarinet, I know that seems stupid btu sice i switched to oboe i haven't played it for months and i miss it a lot. I think i might play it today, i have to find it in this mess of a room first though, heh
1	The rough edit of  The Idiocy Vice  is almost ready. It currently runs for 124 mins, a figure which is definitely gonna have to come down. I've put a couple of shots from the film up on the front page of the  website . Apart from that, not much else to report!

0	so i got a letter from northern day....  .....i didnt get in..... :-(
0	Back at the U.  Got back last night real late, then had to write a paper that was due today.  Between that and waking up at 530 to regester I am extremly tired.  Besides that I have had a lingering depression all day.  I dont know why, I just am.  Hopefully tonight I can get caught up with schoolwork, and get nights rest and maybe in the morning I can feel better.
0	i realized that sometimes i say stuff that maybe i should just keep to myself- peoples emotions go up and down- especially about relationships and its almost always a garentee that if your feeling dejected... feeling like its not worth it then if you give yourself time to think about it, youll change your mind and be upset at yourself for even thinking that in the first place- so sorry brady for bieng such an ice bitch sometimes- the steelers lost :(:(:( boooooooo

0	I've come to where I am because I never thought that I could not accomplish what I set out to do.  Every obstacle I've overcome, every stumbling block,  every triumph,  all victories were expected.  Part of the plan.  I know what's supposed to happen: I face a problem, find a solution, adapt, overcome, move on.  Sure, I may whine a bit,  complain about difficulties, but I never seriously have had DOUBTS about whether I'd get through it all --  I'd get where I wanted ultimately.  'til now.  the whispered "what if"s I used to brush away, merely mutter and forget,  are screaming now And it's hard to ignore the uncertainties, the HUGE investment  that might never come to be  And I'm just sitting here on my knees begging the powers that be to not take this all away, leaving me broken, a waste,  burned out, seeping hopelessness and ultimately alone.
0	 I shouldn't sit at the third floor MC table. No work gets done there.  And me not getting work done is not being with something I love, so  it only makes me feel worse and worried. But if I hole up to work, I'm not  in the social network, and thus have nowhere to go once I am done.   Campus Crusade For Cheese: Looks like I'm the VP Cheddar (aka Treasurer)  for the next term. No problem.   Saw some "Mathnet" episodes from the 80's Square One TV productions. Yes,  it's a take-off on "Dragnet". It's actually remarkably good, but the humour is  so varied and the reasonning examples substantial enough that I'm not sure what  age group it's aimed at.   Got invited to a party at Jim M.'s place. I guess I'm going.
1	Yayayayayy! Hopefully everyone will be healthy tonight. I'm covering the general peds service tonight. I have $9 in meal coupons to be used before Tuesday when they expire, and my happy call blanket with me. Call is always better with a blankie from home. I don't care how old I am. I hate hospital blankets. You never know who's been dying or bleeding in them or doing otherwise not-so-good things in them. YAY VACATION! Yay Cleveland! I'll see everyone soon!
1	^-^ Yay! My first entry! &gt;.&gt; Anyways I feel very happy today for no reason whatsoever. I guess that's just how i am. Happy. I have no clue what to right next so i'll just stop before i drive people crazy. wait...I can wrote more! i just remebered something!(thats very rare) My mom had this garage sale...and it sucked, so i saved it by making pretty signs, and my mom keeps kicking me off the comp &gt;.&lt; so i have to go.
1	So I have a place to live next year... woohoo. We got a solid, relatively inexpensive place in the McGill student ghetto, uh, yeah... fo' shizzle. The problems are as follows: 1) Lease starts May 1st... gotta see if we can sublet. 2) No furnishings - I sense a few trips to Ikea. 3) As one roommate is from New Jersey and the other is from Protection Island (hehe), BC, we can't very much move furniture we already own, so we have to buy most of it.  I'm just glad to have signed a lease and get done with it.
1	brand new red chuck taylors make me happy.  i begged iris to let me move -- anywhere, even an isle cube.  the master plan is that if my move is approved, the rest of the guys near me will demand it too.  then, 5 people will want to move -- it will be much cheaper to move genie instead of all of us. ;-)  genie is worse than that annoying "accounts payable, just a moment" bimbo in office space.  quarterly they need to move genie to a new corner of the GDC so everyone can experience it.  its really affecting my ability to get out of bed in the morning.    that is all.
0	It all happened so long ago. who started what,  who's mad at who? I know I did some wrong and I know you did too. why am I the only one appologizing time after time? I can't turn back the clock or change the things of the past all we can do is start over from the here and now  forget the wrongs and hurts and do it right. You are so close yet I cannot touch you. Days of your sheltering embrace, calm assurance, gentle encouragement are gone. here are the days of cold, distant, forced conversation. Once I think that I am over this hurt why do all the feelings come rushing back?

1	Kimmy is official potty trained now!  I thought it would never happen.  The Bean (aka Courtney...aka super kid!) was fully trained by 2yrs.  Randy was 2 yrs 8 months which is basically Kimmy's age now.  Damn there is just nothing cuter than a tiny hiney in Dora the Explorer panites.  LOL.
1	like a tiny kid with grubby hands grabbing more candy than you can fit in your stomach but you still try to eat it all in one bite which leads you to the bathroom where it all comes back out and then the regrets  washing like waves of acid eating away at whats left of your hardened spirit  someones knocking at the door its so faint over the roar of the voices in your head  if only you hadnt gotten yourself sick again maybe you could answer the call youve been waiting for with more pain in a second than youve felt in your lifetime you let the door open to all your vulnerbilities letting go of all your held on to so tight you fall into the arms of the only one who cared  feeling the grace that you dont deserve from the person you hurt the most it doesnt make any sense but you know you need it and cant live without it cause youve tried so you fall and sob until youve soaked the whole floor with everything you let go and with everything you let go

With the amount of money that my parents are paying them I know they can....) Anyway...highlight of the afternoon? I ♥ science.  Sigh. I sat behind two girls from my hall on the bus today.

0	 A technician who made plutonium fuel pins for power plants back in the '70's read as contaminated when she left her workstation, so she was decontaminated. She went back to work, and was fine through the rest of the shift. The next day, as she was leaving, she read as contaminated and again went through decontamination. On the third day, they checked her out coming into the plant and she was all but  glowing in the dark .   So they dispatchehd a team to her apartment, and found traces of plutonium in the kitchen, bathroom, and high concentrations in her bedroom. Most of her personal possessions were so contaminated they had to be destroyed and she was quarantined at Los Alamos to see how badly her vital organs were affected.  She returned to work a week later.  Coming home from her first day back, she died in a car crash. 
0	I miss Jessi - I wanted to grow old with her. I wanted to start a family with her. I miss her, and her family - I miss how I was part of their family. I love them all.  I miss Sara - As odd-couple as we were, I miss her. I miss the Christmas I had with her and her family too... they are as dysfunctional as mine.  Is it odd that I miss them so much? I mean - I know it's normal to miss the exes from time to time... but, god damn - this is too much.
0	 Man -fuck- all of this...I just wrote a long entry and it was deleted.  -exagerated sigh-  Well, I'm not gonna write it all over again because 1) I'm too damn lazy, and 2) I can't remember a thing I wrote.  But let me tell you peeps this:  Today has sucked major ass and it's getting worse!  -gets real upset and makes ugly mean mad faces-  heh.  Byes.   *wanders off slowly*   Emil...come to me!?...pleeeeaaase!!

0	On Friday night, my aunt passed away. She was 55 years old and in good health. Apparently, she had an enlarged heart for some reason and it failed after having dinner with my uncle at their house. I have a large extended family, and my aunt was one of those who always have parties at their large house due to room and close proximity to a great playground. I spent many summers there when I was under 12 years old, especially since her youngest son was about a year older than me. I didn't go to work Monday or Tuesday so I could attend the wake and funeral. There was a large turnout for both, and the Joliet Traffic Unit provided an escort and traffic control for the procession due to the high volume of cars (roughly 80 I believe, if not more).   R.I.P.

1	A friend from church asked me to watch a store he owns (a sports memorabillia (sp?) store at that) while he is away on contract work. Its only a couple of days a week, but its work none the less. So I have started this morning, and am presently sitting in the store watching highlights from the 2003 cricket world cup in South Africa. Can't complain :D  Mind you, everyone who has walked into the store this morning is asking me about getting items they have framed. This is not my area of expertise unfortunately. While custom framing is done here, they are all asking me to give quotes. Hmmmmm..... Slight panic :S  Oh, the Australians just won the world cup. Again. For the seoncd time this morning. Go us! *g*
1	 LAN PARTY   Julie's gonna be gone for pretty much the entire weekend. LANing tonight with Dima, Espen, Nic, CC, Vilde, Ivan, & maybe one of Ivan's friends. And then going to Lillestrøm tomorrow and going to be there for like 1278128172 hours. Then coming back, and returning to the LAN party.  Expect late-night tiredness, bibbliness, insanity, and generally much breaking of my mind on Saturday night. &lt;3  Vilde's mom is picking me up soon, so okay, see you all on late Sunday! 8D    *SQUEE*
0	yeah. i obviously deleted that entry. i guess i shouldnt have even written it in the first place. FUCK! i guess i need a new guy or something. someone whos just completely amazing. lately i havnt met anybody like that. or that could compare. FUCK! whatever. why did i wait so long when i knew it would lead to nothing? it doesnt even matter.
0	I missed Canada AM this morning. Did anyone tape it? I'll buy a copy, and pay for shipping and everything... Or even if you don't have a copy, if you let me borrow yours, I'll send it back once I've copied it. Pleeeeaaase? If you could email me at saramayf@hotmail.com I'd be forever in your debt!
1	My fucking birthday bitches. Playing cards tonight, so if you don't have the time to call me or didn't get me anything, just say "good luck tonight Aaron" to yourself out aloud. I am playing cards tonight and if I happen to play good i could be taking home over $700. My dad is amazing for buying my way into this game. I'm off to sleep, gotta rest up before the big game. Go cardinals. Fuck yeah. XXX
1	 Susan's  daughter, Millicent, arrived at my door at 9:30 am.  She had two suitcases, a war-torn egg, and a note that read  Dear Eleanor Roosevelt, Millicent is knocked up with the child of a cad.  She was going to abort it but she changed her mind.  Please talk to her.  Especially make sure you convince her to have an abortion.  Warmest regards, Susan. I brought her in, fixed her a warm cup of pumpkin-milk, and put her egg out in the henhouse.  (I have a henhouse to lure foxes to turn into foxmeat.  Hahahaha.  No hens though.)  I'll start talking to her about her pregnancy tomorrow.  Today she needs to rest.
1	I have these old bananas in the kitchen...should I make banana bread or banana pudding? I'm leaning towards pudding. MMMMM.   Yesterday I went bonkers in the produce section. I bought strawberries, peaches, plums, cherries...and a ton of veggies. heh heh. I'm gonna have plenty of fiber.
0	mmmmmm.... the thermophile in me is happy... Seattle, where the weather is always cool is finally having a hot streak - it will be in the 90s! I think for the first time we've been out here! But what I liked about the hot weather back in MI is having a place to swim and being able to go out and do things like water skiing... Not so much to do here - anglers crowding the lakes for a one day sockeye season, ocean too cold... *sigh* And we had airconditioning in MI... So yeah. I really haven't got much to say.. it's been a... well, kind of dull weak, I guess.

0	I've been thinking a lot, between being bored at work and having nothing to do at home. I've taken refuge in a Super Nintendo Soccer game, but I can't beat Spain so... Me thinking is never a good thing, I always just confuse things in my life and mess them up. So much of this is ironic and may be just a cry for help to all the people that I care about so much. I just can't get the problems that I am tring to ignore of my mind and it's driving me insane.
0	So my grandpa gave me $100 cash for Christmas. I figured that this should be spent directly on a nice present for myself. So I did a bit of research and Best Buy was/is selling 160GB hard drives for $89! Amazing! I went out and bought one at about 8PM today. It's so sweet. Top-of-the-line, great reviews, and my whole family can enjoy it (we are always downloading music). Except... Those poor people in Asia. I keep reading about the tsunami on Google News and BoingBoing. It's not fair that I should spend my  vacation  buying toys for myself. So tomorrow morning I'm going to take it back, and I'm going to send the whole $100 to Architecture for Humanity (unless someone can recommend a Canadian charity that is helping with relief/reconstruction efforts?)  Dang  conscience . 160 gigabytes!
1	Hi, I'm at Meghan's house. =D I wann a have a sleepover with her tonight. Hopefully my mom will say yes. But I think Sadie wants to have a sleepover with me at her house tonight also.  But anyway,IT'S SUMMER! =) I'm kinda sad school ended, though. But no more elemantary school!!! =) No more lines. Hehe...I think I'm going to start making friends only posts soon. No one really reads my live journal so it doesn't matter. =P   Allison was being a burr today. She such a tatle-tale. =P  My summer is going to be very boring. Besides band camp, I'm not going anywhere. My mom wants to go to England again, but we probably won't end up going.   Well, I think I'm boring Meghan. I guess I'll go now. Bye!
1	i'm really starting to get excited about the U of H thing...it really sounds like what I want.  I'll still definately be visiting Seattle this summer though.  My tax refund is going to be just enough to pay for the plane ticket.  And, i might get to go to Austin this weekend.  And it's 16 days til my birthday.  Awesome.
1	Well yesterday I won the Dom autograph again. Well today I won another Orlando one and some rare Elijah bookmarks. They are not like the ones of him as Frodo, they are different!! Am happy about that!!  Anyway...things have been pretty good!! For the most part, church went good. Nathan and I get along good for the most part!! I really enjoy it!!  Robbie has really taken to Nathan and that makes me happy, but makes my parents angry. Hmmmmm, anyway...all is good and will write more tomorrow.   P.S. I start my job on Wednesday. I work 5pm to 12am. Take care all!!

0	I just asked Brandon out and he said no.  I don't think my feelings would get hurt but they did.  So now I am little upset. I actually thought I would get my first boyfriend tonight, but again I was wrong.    He says I am too god for him and he can't stand the thought of him hurting me, but by me asking I am willing to.
0	Poor Daphne has been having the worst of health lately.  She's been having back problems, so today my mom took her to the vet for surgery, however, once the surgery was over, Daphne started bleeding.  When the vets examined her, it turned out that every part that the main vet touched when performing the surgery was bruised and/or bleeding.  It appeared to have been caused by rat poison. She got a blood transfusion and now appears to be holding her own, but she hasn't gotten to a comfortable state yet, and we haven't heard anything about her in 4 hours.  We're all basically upset over poor Daphne's condition, and we're praying to God that she will be healed.  Things have been going pretty decent so far otherwise.  It was an otherwise typical day, with work being fast but fun, and me getting killed by bunnies in FFXI.  However, I did get my senior pictures taken, and they look quite good.
0	w/e fuck this shit. Ive said it a million times and i'll keep sayin it cause its the only fuckin way i can let out these fucking feelings. I should know by now that nothing good in life comes without some kind of catch that you dont see untill after ur already fucked. so w/e fuck it i dont care about anything anymore my only life is in a sport.  Nothing will ever matter to me again cause the only thing that did matter to me is gone and i know damn well its not comin back. i still fuckin dream about her like almost every night. as a matter of fact i just had a dream the other night that we got back together and said we were sorry, and in my dream i woke up and i was so happy it wasnt a dream but it still was, then i woke up for real, back to shitty reality. Call me crazy and obsessed w/e say whatever the fuck you want, i dont care. its not like i have a reputation to keep. so yeah now im gonna go sleep and go back to false hapiness.

1	Thanksgiving was AWESOME!  I got see Noah.  YAY!  I met Noah's family.  YAY!  We finished a 500-piece puzzle with his dad, who later quit.  That was just funny.  We all went to see 'Finding Neverland"...Mmmmm Johnny Depp.  I mean.  Um... It was good.  And, we ate Thanksgiving dinner twice, which is always a good thing.  The only bad thing was that Noah was sick, so he got me and his sister sick.  BOO!
1	Ok, you jerks. I finally finished a dumb ol' drawing. Since I have no scanner right now, I am forced to use Photoshop. Also, I'm desperately trying to redo my Crapstone. With all new characters and a developed storyline. So this ended up being a week's-worth of work on one  character  I came up with, and finished today.
1	i leave in 7 and a half hours for NYC! i cant wait. im tired though. just wanted to tell everyone happy thanksgiving! ill be freezing my butt of with marian at the parade on thurs. watch for us! lol Have a good holiday! i love ya!

0	Well, it finally came.   The day that couples are happy and the singles are not. It is the best day ever for someone in a realtionship and you get to get roses and chocolates and teddies and so on and so forth.  But for people like me, who are single, this is the worst day of the year for them. I mean, i swear to god that all the couples walking around me were out to get me yesterday. Is it really my fault that no-body likes me?  I did however, get 3 roses. 1 from andrew, who gave it to me this morning which was totally unexpected, 1 from rojan (you rock rojan!), and one from someone I don't know, who nadia, by the way, keeps on insisting that I sent it to myself, when I didn't!  So that made me feel better. And people who are all happy-dappy, lovey-dovey, like sarah and elle with their jojos and toms whatever, they make me want to cry. hehe.  Well, hopefully, I'll have someone next year.  bec xoxo
1	  The shepherd isn't watching his flock.  Take me fishing.  This summer, I want to meet someone new. Or someone old, even.  This summer, I want to spend my birthday with friends.  I want some shiscabobs.  Sunday, May 1st, is the fairy festival.  I want to lose some of my stress, by keep on my toes.  I need to bring up these grades.  What does my SAT score mean?  I'd like to skip school and go to a theme park.  Next Halloween I'd like to act like a kid again, and  not  have scarlet fever.  I want to swim, when it's chilly, for fun.  
1	Alright, as of - last night I am no longer living in my house. Joe and I packed up all my shit and we're going to finish moving it in after I get out of work tonight. We might not even be living at Joe's house for as long as we thought after all. We might be getting our own apartment as-soon-as this weekend. Joe went to look at two places this morning, an apartment and a house. He took pictures for me with my digital camera because I had to work and couldn't go look at it. How awesome is that? Well, anyway the man renting them wants me to see them first; so I might be going to look at them on Thursday. We have some finagling to do because of our situation but, I think we could do it. Ok, I'll stop rambling now. Hah. HM. I'm bored and I'm at work and I have nothing to do at the moment. I guess I'll go and be bored somewhere else. Hahahaa. Later kiddies.
1	Had the most lovely evening last night. Mitch Hedberg and friends. On my way home this morning I thought I could drive all day and sing along with the CDs I've been neglecting.   But no. I opted to invite more bitter criticism into my life, consequently spending a chunk of my morning in bed crying. Crying until I was laughing out loud at the irony of it all.  Went to walk it off at the boat docks and found a pen, a shard of metal, and a gum wrapper. I was nearly dancing my way home while singing in the pouring rain. You could've seen me in the dark I was glowing so bright. It's all about the timing.
1	Hey all! I'm excited to find out that WGN is going to show 2 hrs of the Mummers Parade!  This is exciting because it was one facet of Philadelphia I was unable to experience. I encourage anyone who is interested in seeing grown men really drunk and dressed in flamboyant costumes parading up Broad Street it should be a good time!  WGN 1/1/05 3-5pm.
1	The Audigy 4 Pro is installed, the SW1000XG's digital output it piped straight into the Audigy's I/O hub, and everything works perfectly and sounds  great! 
1	So, as of about 24 hours ago...     Brian and I are engaged!! :)
1	It's 25˚ here... beautifully windy and sunny... I didn't want to stay at work, so I decided to ask my boss if I could 'work' from home... she's not around and her lab assistant said "Hell, Stacey's not here, and I don't care what you do... enjoy the comfort of home Les..."... so here I am... summe iTunes blasting... windows wide open... sun shining... sunglasses keeping my hair out of my face... God I love it here.... I love 'working' from home....

1	Jet Blue is having a sale between here and New Orleans.  $65 each way.  They're also celebrating their fifth anniversary and giving out tickets.  The first 100 people to show up at one of their five locations (there's one by my apartment!) dressed as their favorite Jet Blue destination with a canned food donation gets a FREE ROUND TRIP TICKET.  Of course, I will be New Orleans.  I will be there at 5:00 AM, fully dressed in Carnival fashion.  There's a thrift shop and a party supply store by my house.  I cannot wait.  I will look a fool.  I spoke to my mom, and she said that in 1979, an airline was having a promo because they were starting a route between New Orleans and Baltimore.  She, her brother, and my dad stood in line and flew to Baltimore for $.79.  SEVENTY NINE CENTS.  Mine will be free!
1	I'm off to a lovely dinner with kriss tonight! Then it's right to bed because I have to work tomarrow. Hey, atleast it's H.O.T. pay.    So anyways. Work today was very weird. I meet the strangest people. I had lots of free time. Me and Tony, thanks to his master key, got on the roof, the tippy top, well I did anyways. I had some climbing to do to get up there. I always wanted to get up there.           This is the picture from the very very top of the antenna house on the 12th floor.    p.s. I also updated the pictures on my MSN picture site. You should look at it.

1	Wow, I am so incredibly happy that I found this site:  http://www.sasugabooks.com    Japanese manga, art books, childrens books, everything I need to enforce this language &lt;3 (And not to mention stuff I don't need. It's only a matter of time before I lose it and spring for the $30 Tales of Symphonia art book.) Plus, they take Paypal. Oh man, I'm so screwed.  SQUEE.
1	 Joss in New York City tomorrow    Yeahhhhhhh!   Just called to confirm (again), that Joss will be one of the speakers at the Symphony Space on Saturday.  Frank Rich is the moderator and the discussion is about popular culture.  When I learned that Joss is due in California on Sunday for another appearance I decided I 'd better double check.  I'm going early to camp out.
0	So in this hypothetical situation... lets say that there was this grad party, and this guy, and these drinks. lets say that some girl consumed those drinks and hooked up with this on guy. Let's say that she is really upset by something that she saw 2 days later involving that guy... not too cool. I got hoed over.... again. This sux and it hurts and I'm sick of the twisted pleasure that guys seem to take when they crush a girl's entire emotional life.  Only a few days/weeks till the bother won't be here. im just worried that ill still want the bother. damn it.     Why does kissing you have to feel so right but be so wrong?
1	 AIYYEEE!!! lookit wot a friend made me!!!   http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/632 8736/  
0	I took Wes to the vet this morning, and he doesn't have distemper.  He has a feline herpes virus.  Its highly contagious in the mucousy stage, so the rest of the cats have it too.  Its incurable, so its chronic.  She compared it to a cold sore-it comes and goes whenever.  So I have a bunch of sneezing, stuffy cats.  Some are getting the mucus in their eyes, she gave me an eye medication to clear that up, but as for the sneezing and stuffiness, she said there isn't anything I can do about it.  Great.  I called around to get prices on psychiatrists, and they are all so freaking expensive.  Mom said our insurance doesn't cover it.  I cried so many times today...I hate doctors.  Why do they have to put a price on peoples' misery?  The more life-threatening disease, or the problem you have, the more expensive to get rid of it.
1	im happy cause im finally going back to hollywood.im kindof sad because im leaving mandy and kim here in sd.
1	I am so stoked! In return for helping       slinkii   /Lisa on a couple of her projects, and       junebug8girl   /Heather on a project of hers I'm covered on the internet for a while! tee hee  Lisa has purchased a years paid LJ service for me, and the extra pics too!  Heather is covering my internet costs for the work I am doing for her. It's awesome.   It's nice not having to worry about that stuff for a while. I was concerned about my paid LJ time expiring after I've done all the work to this site, and now I'm good til May '06! woo hoo!!!! ha ha ha  I know it may seem like no biggie to some of you, but it's made my day, that's for sure! tee hee  More later...
0	Today has been ridiculous, my friend is being completly unreasonable. He wants to dismember rob, and i warned him against such threats and so now he's pissed at me because he thinks , i don't know what the hell he thinks.  Why don't people listen to me? It's like i'm talking and they don't hear a single thing...  i don't think i like people anymore...
0	  Boys are bad.   They make me sad.  Alright i've written enough poetry this week.  But seriously.   I haven't updated in quite a long while. and i don't really feel like doing it right now... maybe later.  mwah!  
1	             We're eccstatic. We have no idea what to even do with it. XD 
1	Ha! A journal. Finally.  All updates that don't fit on the site will go here along with rants and other thing. :P Also, if anyone knows where to find premade layouts for this (if there are any) please  email me.  Thanks you everyone!
0	Today was a very sad day for everyone. I went to school and found out someone commited suicide i didnt know the person so i didnt think much bout it. Well when i got to 4 period everyone was extremely sad, and espicially Kacy. She wasnt feeling to good bout everything, but seeing her like that almost made me cry. I hope i never see u like that again Kacy it hurts me. I hope u feel better tom.   Later
0	My grandmother on my dad's side is 95, and has pneumonia; this less than a week after she had surgery to repair her broken hip after she fell.  She's on IV antibiotics, but my mother has already called her boys to let us know we need our shirts and stuff ready in case of funeral.  Poor Grandma.  My grandfather died of alzheimers when I was... 9?  9 or 7, it was a long time ago.  She's suffered from Dementia for the last six years, to a greater or lesser extent, and it has been greatly complicated by her hearing loss.  Without being able to talk to people and understand, even when we visited her frequently, it was hard on her.  Hard on us, too, because she used to be brilliant, as my mom said.  My dad definitely picked up his razor edge from her, and to a certain extent I from him, when I'm having a good day.  My Dad mentioned something she said to him a long time ago, which I imagine was hard to hear from his mom.  "Whenever God's ready to take me, I'm ready."
0	I've been  ordered requested to try and set up the desktop computer to the internet again.   But it's hard! And having had a decent connection for 30 s makes it so much more depressing when it stops working again.   whimperwhimperwhimper
1	What is your favorite song on the soundtrack? I really like Blue Eyes, The Only Living Boy In New York, Caring Is Creepy, and Fair. But Fair is my all-time favorite,  Just wondering what everyone else likes  -annie
0	        Hours   Spiral and coil into black   Some remembered, some forever gone      Tragic   We never get them all back   The relentless march of time must still go on      Forgotten   Events obscured by the past   Without remembrance did they occur at all?      Losing   At best a tenuous grasp   And nothing below to break the fall       Imagine     What moments those lost hours hold     Things we missed that might have changed our lives       Stranded   With no way to get home   The light around us starting to subside 
1	Stolen from       takairino         Post the names of 13 of your favorite musicians. See who can guess which is your favorite song by each.

The highlights:  --Jen and i learned how to kick the crap out of each other. --We made a giant caterpillar and alice snow sculpture in front of the school. --Snow ball fights --got to stop in at becky's birthday party for a bit. --Awesome dance party in the cafe and mez --I got an award. A bunch more noble people did too! --Noble was definitely the funnest school there. --Even though we didnt win, we get to do it all again next weekend.  I'm going to bed now. Dancing around like an idiot is very tiring.
1	Happy Halloween! Well, almost. This place gets CRAZY on halloween weekend. People from all over Ohio come here. They shut down the middle of the city because there are too many people. I'm going as Martha Stewart in prison. It should be fun.  I have SO much homework to do this weekend that it's cruel. I have to read a 300 page book, study for a bio test and Women's Studies test and make up all the spanish homework I missed. *brain explodes*
1	I have an sex-related filter that I occasionally post things to (and will be adding some girly-shots to soonish).  If you aren't on it, and would like to be, let me know.  It's stuff that I don't want to be throwing out into the web at large, so please don't duplicate it to anywhere public.

0	Jesus I'm tired like a bitch.   Some weekend I had.  Went with Rob and Adam to a hotel partay.  It was certainly.... interesting, but like always I kinda felt the outcast.  I drank some wine, but didnt get drunk.  I dont think I did, who knows with our constantly fading memories.  I was gonna stay at Adam's house, but when it was time to go he couldn't get off of his drunk ass.  What a bitch face.  Well I ended up staying at Rob's and he raped my urethra hole.  He dropped me home and promised to give me candy if I didnt tell anyone.  What a great guy.  I went straight to the computer and I downloaded an SNES game called Super Robot Wars 4 and it kept me up till 5 am.    Fuck i was suppose to type a report for class on Monday but I didnt do it cause I'm an idiot.  Jesus I'm gonna fail and then I'll never pass high school.  I'm the worst kind of scum on the island...... ok maybe that's stretching it.  Someone straighten out my spine  I slouch cause slouching makes me feel alive.
0	 Welcome to April.    And no more tricking me out of the Juno's. Bastards.    And now, the rest of yesterday.    After baseball, went back to school, did LA... which was boring and stupid. Math was easy and fun. Then had......    &nbsp;    OMG, what? ARGH.     OK, then had... scriptwriting, which was stupid. I had to work with Jessie, but we couldn't think of anything... yet another class to fail.    Then CAPP, which me, Ryan and Jordan had trouble with cause Mr J had shitty instructions.    Leadership, we talked about SEVEC and worked on Science stuff. I hate it... just hate science.    &nbsp;    After school, I called Tiffany, but she was still in Teris. Or wherever. I went out shopping for a new desk, might have found one... I went to FS and got a Billy Talent CD. It's good...... XD    I also went to the mall, and got a couple mags, Chart and Twist.     &nbsp;    Speaking of which, I have to mail in that form. DAMN.    I guess I have to go.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    Bye.    &nbsp; 
0	well it's finally happened. I stepped on the scale today, and I have reached the dreaded 130 lbs. I can't believe it! I mean, I know I'm 4 1/2 months pregnant, but not even that could prepare me for this. I hate it. All the extra weight has settled in my boobs, abdomen,and hips. Ugh, I am so ugly, I swear. I have been exercising as much as I can without getting too uncomfortable, and still I'm gaining fat fat fat!! I just needed to vent this. Hopefully it will be a lllooong time, maybe even never, before I hit...gulp...well, you know, ten lbs more than now. Stay strong all!! Love, tina
0	Sad today, more than usual. I have a poem for Kim, just haven't the drive to put it in writing.  So, lets add pathetic to the list of feelings for today.

0	So here i sit watching the notebook....which is kinda sad and pissing me off, however it doesn't help that i find myself wanting that lifelong love of the characters in the movie. And it's not like i belive in just one person for everyone but geesh a little love/romance in my life would be great. It's not that i don't appreciate what i have, but sometimes i miss that feeling :-(  Oh well so tomorrow is my mom's b-day so i am going down to her house to see her. It should be fun. I can't believe that my week off from school and grad school is almost over. Damn i need more downtime.
0	         You Are Whiskey             You're a tough drinker, and you take it like a man That means no girly drinks for you - even if you are a girl You prefer a cold, hard drink at the end of the day Every day, in fact. And make that a few.        What alcoholic drink are you?      How very fitting, now pass me some, I need it in a bad way
0	ok hey ppl im just so blah today im sitting with my bro we went outside during...ooooooh scary jeanne... and played catch with a plastic bag.. lol my dad wouldnt let me get my skateboard and an umbrella and go outside :( that woulda been so fun oh well... stuck inside fer the rest of the day.. im gunna go play guitar..  love ~ brooke
0	What the Hell is Wrong with me?? Tell me what you think.
0	havent posted in awhile. no real reason to post. nothing but crap is really happening... maybe ill update when something happens thats worth posting
0	 I hate what I do.     I hate who I am.      And even more than that, I hate the reduction of who I am that I've become. 
1	Well I reread my last entry and it seems I haven't been here for a while. Because I am so not self-pitying myself now! Oh it's wonderful. There's this guy (yeah well you knew it had to start off like this) who is just the sweetest, sexiest, everythingist and he likes me! (He likes me , he really likes me) He is just... oh I don't know how to say it. I have this huge smile on my face all day. People must think I'm insane or something but I don't care. And he's so patient with me and my nerves. Hell I know I'm annoying but he never gives any indication that he feels that way.   Yes there is a HUGE smile on my face because I'll be seeing him tonight (he called me!!) and this weekend, and next weekend and July 4th weekend... I never had it so good.   One of the best things is that he already knows the family. He's hung around with us for a couple of years now so I don't have to worry about that. Of course I've never met his family but that's all in the future. And so is something else...

0	I went to the Yankees game with Matt today. That was fun. They one 7-3. My dad was a riot...it was great. The worst part of the trip was going home, when a guy was hanging out of his window and vomiting. Ewwww. I wasn't the clear kind, either. No, it was the chunky kind, all over the road and side of the car. Ewww...I almost threw up from looking at it, but I held it in. lol.   Got home around 8 or 9. I don't remember. I haven't done anything.  I've been in better moods...stupid shit on my mind..same stupid shit that's always on my freeking mind...it'll be gone in the morning. It always is.
1	If you read my journal  or just skim my entries when you see them on your friends list, Even if I don't speak to you often and I probably hate you and constantly belittle you to our mutual friends, You must post a memory of me, It can be anything you want, it can be good or bad, Just so long as it happened. Then post this to your journal. See what people remember about you.
1	Luce went to Diagon Alley with his Mum, Miss Zabini, and Mr. Riddle, and he got all sorts of new clothes and lots of sweets for all of us. We're going to have a monthly delivery of sweets for our meetings! And he also got this very beautiful necklace for Dio.  I'm going to give it, as well as lots of sweets, to her when we're down in the lab after classes.  I love her so much and I hope she likes it--it looks like something she'd wear, it has black and red stones on it and it's on a black velvet band.     Da hasn't written yet but I bet he's still got guests there, nobody ever leaves the hunts early.

0	Dad wants to send me away. I heard him say so to Adam one the phone.  Should known it was too much to hope for that dad and  mom  Claire would want me around.   It's my fault they fight all the time.     I don't even think Claire really loves me anymore. I guess having a kid is too hard.
1	My parents are going to be gone for the next 72 hours!  Finally some peace and quiet around here.
1	Fucking veerappan was shot in the right side of his fucking forehead!! Asshole had killed around 2000 elephants. Kidnapping MLAs is okay but killing elephants? Son of a bitch shouldn't be given any kind of burial. Should get his stinking body ran over by elephants million times. Fuck all those villagers who helped him in hiding; not to mention the govt itself.   http://specials.rediff.com/news/2004/oc t/19sld1.htm

Chris called it a "cell"... i dont know why... nir..  ummm..... so ... thats all i have ... other than the fact that i didnt walk to school this morning because it was too cold.

0	It looks like I'll be moving to Florida....  The head of the company wants me to move down there.  I guess I'l go for a few months, then ask to be moved back to Pittsburgh.  It will probably be a good vacation.

0	I came into work today, excited since it was my first day as trainer.  I come to find out that my boss/friend was murdered.  By his wife. I mean - what the fuck? He was a great guy. Not just as a boss that would stand up for you, help you get promotions, etc. But if you needed to bs to him about anything outside of work he was there to listen as well. Jerry Richards, R.I.P. buddy. I will miss you.
1	Helllllp! x_X;;;     Greetings, I am MiaoMiao7      And I am Princess_Veona      We wish to spread the excellent news!      Today, on 19th October 2004, at the age of 947 days, I, Princess_Veona, was hereby painted desert as Caz won a 385K paintbrush on auction      It didnt help Caz's nerves any that as the auction ended, she was eating lunch. Not her fault naturally. Luckily, nobody thought to outbid her or anything...      I'm desert! Desert! I'm a Desert Aisha!      I'm... a Split Aisha    Well, I'm a Baby Aisha. Now please go away -_-' My journal.  A lot has happened since my last post. We lost Sadie *sniff* But Caz has given me a new petpet. I now have a Puppyblew named Saphira, but I'll never forget Sadie... um, yeah, thats pretty much it. Not really a lot, I guess. We're very happy that Vivi is finally desert, she's wanted to be one... forever.    Yay! I finally painted Vivi desert! I rock!  
0	i got a new journal. i'm in the deadjournal now. ::sob:: i don't know why i did it. i posted an entry, then panicked.

0	Hello to all,  It may be sometime before I can do much regular posting...I got home late last night after the Reba concert to find my hard drive clicking and poping. It will only boot to the C:/ prompt...NOT GOOD!! Any way I am going to check email from mom's computer from now, but not much else!  I guess I am going computer shopping since I no longer have the luxury of having a personal computer tech in my house...*sigh* hahahh!!!    bye for now! Redd

That address is  http://cyndaquil55.conforums.com/  . I am twenty seven today, but the babyfur that is in me is only three and he will stay as a three year old.

1	I JUST TALKED TO DESIREE! First time in 8 MONTHS! This whole time she has been grounded. I cant believe how much i missed. Ah i love her SO much she has gone through so much shit i feel so guilty not being able to be their! So it's settled...I am moving back to wisconsin(how am i telling my parents)after this school year to be with her. she goes to "town of lake high school" and its full of black people(I am NOT racist.just hate assholes),she gets made fun of really bad. Oh it will be so perfect because my cousin goes their and ah perfect i think this was ment to happen, sure i'll have to live with my asshole dad but hey i'll be getting outta vegas, i wont have to go to church or deal with my mom's daily breakdowns,taking care of crying kids,besides my dad actually lets me say what i want, and my grades are real good so that will shut him the fuck up anyway. i am so happy
1	I'm going to run a pub!  No, not a bar, that's different. I'm going to run a good, British, family public house. And we'll serve pub food, and have a playground outside for the kids, and we'll do fancy cocktails at Christmas. Hee.   And no, Dove, none of my barmen will give you free drinks.
0	The only difference between heaven and hell is the mood we are in.
0	Well today was just a bad day. I guess it just was because I am so bored. I started out being really bored and then I became really depressed. I guess I just wanted to hang out with some friends. Well pretty much everyone at this school has someone they always hang out with. But I guess I am the exception. I guess I just feel like a loser sometimes. But here the thing I know that Im not a loser. This is just a normal feeling that everyone experiences every once in a while. Today just sucked because it is just one of those days. Also I havent gotten to much sleep lately, so I think thats a contributer to being blue. So yeah I think I am going to go watch a little T.V. and then go to sleep. I think I am going to go in to work tomorrow, I defiently need the money.
1	Today I recieved soooo much advice. Some good, but most bad, but in the end it was all helpful in one way or another.  Dinner was an interesting conversation today. It was the whole nuclear family today, so my bro was there too. The conversation went something like this:  Dad: Whats with this kid, bringing home girls and the like? Me: We're just gonna be having dinner and watching a movie, with perhaps a walk. Dad: Where you gonna watch the movie? The family room? Me: No no we're gonna watch something downstairs. Dad: ALL ALONE?!?! Me: Ummmm... yeah. Dad: NOT ON MY WATCH! I'm gonna be down there "working". (slight pause) Dad: Even better, I'm gonna come walking down the stairs in only my underwear... And scratching my back! And then I'll say something to the effect of, "Who are you little girl?!?!" Thats sure to fix your wagon. See if she'll visit you again!
1	Dive bag - Checked Passport - Checked Luggage - Checked Toiletries - Checked Entertainment - Checked Money - Checked  So I guess this is it... Gonna go soon... Two days Advance Dive Course at Tioman.     WHEE!!!   
1	Unless I'm seriously unlucky, tomorrow will be my last ever 6am start coz I'm finishing work. I'm over the moon. I wasn't supposed to be working this week at all but the girl that has taken over from me had booked a holiday so I had to come in. I did take yesterday off to have the 3rd out of 4 fillings, that the Dentist says I need (although she couldn't see one of them). But then my mum and I went to Ikea (admittedly it was my first time ever) and bought....alot of stuff, mostly for my room and for uni so basically all for me. I know it sounds spoilt but I haven't been shopping for ages and my parents have conveniently put off buying my 18th/19th Birthday and Christmas presents. Oh and I've booked my holiday to the South of France so definitely in an excitable mood. : )
1	that the Small Faces are alive and well and living in Brighton!!!!!!!!
1	I don't have to pay for anything! Nothing!  Even though my money hasn't come through yet, they will give me some temp. money to pay for everything until my check comes!  Awesome!    My bank still says I'm overdrafted cuz they are assholes... I am no longer using the bank... Not for the sorry amount of money I make... From now on they will cash my checks and give me my money, and that's it...  But I don't have to pay for ANYTHING! Finally!
0	  I wanted Buttercup to scratch my head...HEEHEE!       My beautiful Buttercup   Me!    Us sitting on the back of  Mommy's  chair.    Me sitting on the monkey that  Uncle Brad  got for mommy. I love biting his nose! HEEHEE!  Das all..
1	today i'm hanging out with lukas, and today is also my mothers wedding, not remaried to husband, married to a dude named "ray", and yeah BIG day today, it seems like everythig is ging by so slow for some reason..i don't know why but whatever, lukas and I have nothing planned for the next 3 and a half hours so we'll be on blitz, hehe
1	The past few days have taken a toll on me. I have been so stressed about the job situation! I didn't want to go, but I wanted to make more money, it was driving me crazy all weekend. Well this morning was beautiful. My boss pulled me in her office, praised me, gave me my promotion papers and then gave me a raise. It just so happens that my raise is more then what Suntrust offered!! So I get to stay where I want and make more money!! It was so embarassing but I cried. I was so overwhelmed when she told me how much I would make that my eyes swelled up and I lost it. I will chalk that up to PMS and personal reasons. Well Ian, you were right. I got a call last night and I am back to being single. I should have known better then to date him, but I will say that he was ever so nice about the whole thing. I can't blame him, he's still hung up. I'd rather him do this then pretend. sucks cause he was growing on me. Oh well. NEW APT HERE I COME!!!!!
1	Happy Birthday to Me, Happy Birthday to Me!  Happy Birthday Mamarayne, Happy Birthday to Me!
0	somethings wrong with me at the moment, something feels wrong... i cant explain it to myself, so dont expect an explanation.... i feel angry and in a way sad. i seem to wanna sit at home instead of going out let my phone ring out instead of being a shoulder to cry on maybe i am "heartless" as it was put to me last night.  it's easter and once again i'm home alone...  i'm a head mess today... i'll piss off.
1	Snow, man!  SNOW!  Snow.  Snow.  Snow.  Snow.  Snow.  Snow.   Snow.

0	hey everybody, I wanted somebody to come over but they couldnt because their friend wouldnt call... (sigh). So I fell like crap right now, anything that can help cheer me up would help...(sigh) I guess thats all for now (walks off looking sad
1	The parade went very well today despite the ridiculous Santa hats we had to wear. Tomorrow I'm going to play at the Light Up Night here in Shannon. Actually Light Up Night is where a bunch of people come together to freeze their asses off and light up three shrubs for fun. I'm going to be there with Ethan, Bri, Crystal, Nikki, Freddie, and Amber. And maybe Heather if she's better but it wouldn't be good for her to be out in the cold when she gets over her illness. It's actually fairly nice not having Heather at school. Never mind.   We went shopping today after the parade and I think I'm done with my Christmas shopping. Yay me!
1	I talked to the guy from Brooks Institute of Photography today. It sounds like a really good school. And I would get to do photography. It's in Santa Barbara. I think I have a good chance of getting in.  Gah, I wish I was a senior this year. I hate how expensive college is.  This weekend is going to suck. No one is around to do anything.
0	Cuz  you'll  I'll never be OK...  You'll always be in pain          I feel truly dead inside.

0	Bueh tahan, midterm test questions all on enumeration of stuff, no proofs at all. I dun like doing a lot of computations. I manage to write 25 - 22 = 1 and so get the rest of the question wrong, which means about 15% down the drain liao. Bueh lun eh...
0	I have to cry.  I swear, I just need to let it all out, this intense aching.  But I've been holding it back so much.  I'm homesick, people-sick, place-sick.  Long Beach is awesome, but it's not Home.  I keep stopping myself from crying now.  I tell myself I have to grow up.  I'm so not ready for that yet.  I know that once I let it all out, I'll feel allright.  Until then, though, I'm a mess.  Good night.

1	Thanks guys for your help with a name for our new addition.  We have decided on the name Samantha for her.  In other news, we now have a teenager in the family.  My daughter turned 13 today.  Im excited for her, but not sure how I feel.  Old, maybe?  I mean, wasnt it just yesterday her uncle had to show her how to eat her birthday cake, by way of the face, hands, hair, etc?  When she was a "Boo Cow" for halloween?  Its amazing how fast time goes by.  Now she is in a whole new phase of life...and its scary for me.
1	For the Buttership has gained port permission to dock in Ocean Springs.  We will set up the supplies at the T&T Teen Club.  I hope your presence will be notice by me, for I am Pat-C.
0	 I have had a whole day to reflect, I have returned to Earth after my little 'high' this morning and no I was not actually high just you know, high on life, as corny as that sounds. I am now at Uni studying for a few things which require my attention or I might be at risk of failing, and that is something I refuse to do, I may not want to be here right now but I most certainly do not want to have to repeat classes that would just be embarassing.      Lo for Spring although present is still dominated by Winter      Cupid is hiding in the Forest      None shall feel his arrow      Until Winter lets go and passes      To allow Spring to take its place      Until then all shall wither      And the cold shall rule      Love shall not spring from this shadow     Yes so must continue.     In case your wondering why I'm feeling so low, it just dawned on me that it is the 6th year anniversary of my Mother's passing.     Terry

0	When they say that you have to take the good parts of life with the bad, they really really mean it.  I got a fish today  And someone close to me lost her mom.  So....while I'm happy for a new addition to my life (Herbie the fish) I'm sad that life is full of such dukkah.  Damn using religion outside of class...
1	A visit to the optometrist today yielded me a pair of glasses that let me see a lot more clearly.  Also has an anti-reflective coating--yay!  Better computing!  Folks can see my eyes more clearly, too.  Fun fun, joy joy.  Not to mention, my knife deal went through, so I've gots spending money!  Life is beautiful.
0	 So the WBRY end of semester lunch just wrapped up, and I feel weird.  Christina doesn't want to have a manager dinner because the management doesn't get along, and I think I was planning on that dinner being my last WBRY thing.  So now that its not happening, I don't have any closure.  I don't know, maybe I'm just upset that I didn't get a plaque or a certificate of some kind.  Thanks a lot guys, I feel so loved.  Then again, we didn't get Hoffy anything as a goodbye.  We suck this year.  But I still want my fucking plaque.  I feel so unloved.  Pictures:     Oh yes.      Nrom.    Just look at the boy's face...lol   So that is the end of my WBRY career.  Rather uneventful.   
1	robyn sent a bad ass e-mail to my parents. they kept calling her phone last night looking for me. if they care so bad where im at, then why did they turn off my cell phone??? my dad didnt respond to her e-mail. i know im still fighting with my parents. i mean what kind of family would rather see you in the streets, than help you out???!!!!     also i might have a job oppritunity coming up soon. whcih is good. hopefully i can keep this job. they pay alot too.   i hope everyone is doing well. im fine. *huggles* =)   =)    =)

1	hey all, sorry if i disapointed you before by not posting for over a motnh..i dont see what the big deal is but whatever, im trying to put off studying u.s. right now...this year is definitely harder than last year  to sum up whats been goin on, ive been busy with yearbook and debate..mostly yearbook, including those excruciating meetings every week at 7 in the morning..starbucks can only help so much..but i definitely enjoy my free period during 15-16 eating whatever candy is in the food closet (i will end up gaining back whatever weight everyone seems to think ive lost, even my mom asked me today)..it is also fairly amusing to pretend i know nothing about yearbook and listen to people argue about what kind of font to use this year..hehehe  ok now i should study

0	 Hunter S. Thompson  is dead. And like all true geniuses, it was because of a shotgun to the face. I swear...the smarter a person is, the more they realize that life just isn't worth living. It's a shame.
0	This is a tragedy.  Look.  Terry died a long, long time ago.  Her brain?  Is quite literally mush.         This is a normal brain.    This is Terri Schiavo's brain.  Her cerebral cortex is GONE.  It's all fluid.  The videos you've seen?  What they haven't told you is those are culled from hundreds of hours of tape in which she did not respond to questions, or to the balloon, or to her mother, or anything.  And don't tell me that her husband is a bastard because he finally moved on after 10 years.   I'm sorry for her parents, but they are, to put it politely, in massive denial.  Terri is never coming back.  She is, at this point, barely animated meat.  And she needs to be let go.  This is why I have a living will.  Also, can we please make this quote:   "We should investigate every avenue before we take the life of a living human being," said House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas. "That's the very least we can do for her."   come back to bite Tom DeLay in the ass someday?  KTHXBYE.
0	well feeling like shit cause on friday every one did stuff and had a whole lot of fun while i sat by myself and i wanted todo something but i got like rejected by every body like ya ok i understand claire and ella had a plan for a while still but w/e and then  i wanted to go to shaylas but she " wasn't aloud to have that many people over" ( ya sure) so i was alone like every oother weekend when people have plans and they either cant have any more people   or they plain just dont want me to come or they really just want to be with who ever all stupid exuces just to say basicly "NO" i dont want you to come for what ever reason listen if you can tell me honestly what im doing wrong that noone seems to want to hang out with me then please tell me!

1	Well it seems all preparations are in order for the party..Now we just have to wait for everyone to arrive.  I look forward to seeing all of the costumes  especially Locke's , and the dancing and..well I'm just looking forward to the party in general.       In the stories my mother told me as a child, there were always grand balls where knights would sweept the ladies of the court off their feet and it would all be just so lovely.  I hope our little party can come somewhere close to comparing to those stories.
0	So me, nate cass, danny, and joe are hanging out, biking.  Were up at save a lot, and this cop shows up.  He comes up and starts tellin us how we can't be jumpin ne thing, and im thinking wtf.  The cop was being quite the dick.  After he gave his little speech, joe asks "so we cant do ne thing."  The fuckin cop's like thats it, im takin u home, ur gettin smart with me.  Wtf, the cop was such a dick.  Well we went to joes to watch, and to tell his mom it wasn't his fault.  We rang the door bell, and kncked twice.  Then we heard her screaming at him.  We knocked again and she came to the window and yelled leave.  So we called and asked for joe, and shes like he cant talk, bye and hung up.  Before we left i yelled whore, cause his mom sucks.  Also, liz, im so srry about earlier, i hope ur not mad at me.
1	Arms much better today, despite being along way from being right.  At least it was my left arm, as I'm right handed ...oi oi !   Just bluffed my way through my weekly meeting, yay! Made it sound like I'm very busy doing lots of work..pfft, yeh right.  Hopefully should have the auto back on the road tomorrow.  It's amazing how much I relied on my car, you don't realise it until it's gone.    This is going to be a good week, I can feel it! :)
0	I knew that the Tall Cool One might lose, but nothing could have prepared me for the disappointment.  Disappointment does not really begin to describe how I feel, but "heartbreak" sounds so melodramatic.  I know it could be worse.  Some right-wing sniper could have put a bullet through Sen. Kerry's sizable heart six months ago.  He is alive and well and just because he lost the Presidential race does not mean he'll sit down, shut up, and play ball.  I know some of you who are reading this probably thought he was a phony, and you have every right to think so.  I, however, believed in the man.  I still do.  I am hurt beyond words that people I love very much have been told by -- what, 10 states? -- that they are freaks of nature.  God makes no mistakes, and that's all I have to say about that.  I hurt inside.
0	 i can't take it anymore.&nbsp; i can't sleep.&nbsp; i can't stop coughing.&nbsp; i feel like absolute shit.&nbsp; and to make it worse, i think my body is rejecting my lip ring.&nbsp; most likely my immune system is fucked up cuz i've been so sick and it's not healing properly.&nbsp; but it's making me really sad.&nbsp; this week has been awful.&nbsp; i've missed classes and it's not getting any better.    i need more hugs.&nbsp;

1	I just found out 2 Fast 2 Furious comes out 9/30/2003 on VHS and DVD and i am going to get it on the first day it comes out and walmart has it for $15.95.i can't wait until saturday comes around because that is when i should have my blades i want to get.I have been waiting for ever to get them since 6th grade and i am now going to 8th.There is nowone who can stop me from becoming a Drag Racer just like my dad.And if you ask me my dad is my drag racing role model.
0	my internet is acting funny :( that makes me sad. i e-mailed a couple ppl but don't know if it got sent.  stoopid internet.  *looks around for things to do* well i suppose i could go and better myself ect..haha, whatever, i'll probably go to sleep early and get nice and rested up for 80's nite.
0	You know, I hate the stomach bug...  It consumed my stomach for about 2 days until it finally found it's way to the toilet.  However, being at home for 2 days also has its effect.  Everyone around you is mad, and you don't understand why.  Ever since my grandmother went to the hospital last week, things have gotten grim.  To try to keep myself occupied, I have been looking for another job, and have been messing around with my cards some.    Now, I get the feeling that no one wants me around.  When I say no one, I'm saying that everyone is giving me a bad time.  The only person who really hasn't given me a bad time is a friend I haven't talked to in a while.  I'm about to the point where I think that no one wants me here.  I wish someone would tell me otherwise.  Anyway, I would say more, but I have to jet.  Those bills really need to be paid before they are late.
1	I found out today that a friend of mine back home will be coming to spend the weekend with me.  I haven't seen him since I moved so I'm looking forward to a chance to catch up.  I guess I should figure out somethings that we can do while he's here.
1	I just dyed my hair recently. And... I think I'm quite happy with the results. I've gotten some weird comments. One of my friends said that I look like GTO. And when my classmate came into class the fist thing he said was "HOLY CRAP!". But... the girls who ARE NOT form my class said that its nice. I don't know. See how it goes la. I'm might experiment with different hair-styles in the future, but for now, this one will do.
1	Today I went to my doctor! It wasn't raining and my neighbor (how doesn't help me last time) help me to get into the taxi.  I'm better! :D The doctor was kind of impress with my progress YES! Unfortunately he put my leg in a cast but is only for two weeks. The funny thing about it is that I don't will lose the start of term in my college :/ I will take of this cast on saturday and my class is on monday. I can't put my leg on the floor until tuesday. This mean that I can't go to my one of my friends birthday. I'm try to think how good will be on tuesday to not be bored stiff. ^_^
0	So I made my very own kitty to play with!       ~Kirideth

1	Hooooboy. What a long week(s?) of nothing! Things seem to be calming down in the village, and the bounce in their steps are returning. It's great to see the vigor returning, I missed the village I always loved for a while. Congrats, everyone.  I, however, am tied to my desk with work as always, but even that seems to be lightening up. Perhaps it's the new help around the office, or the village reputation returning to it's healthy state. I'm not sure but I like it. Feel like going out and enjoying the Konoha air once again. Maybe stretch my old bones with some training. Mmm, regardless.     I'm glad to see your mission went well. You'll have to come in and tell me about the more defining details, hmm? 
1	this weekend was GREAT!!!... friday- soccer game, we lost 0-5, the nothing Saturday-i went to see a play it was soo cool, but it was a play without ne talking beside those three words in that one song, lol, i met Hayleys cousins,uncles, and aunts..it was cool, THEY AREN'T AS BAD AS SHE SAYS THEY ARE....  lol   .... Sunday- confermation, then i worked on my bio research paper                          §ean
1	I really want to see the new Tim Burton movie...   
0	Manic Depression's touching my soul, I know what I want, but I just don't know how to go about getting it.  Feeling, sweet feeling drops from my finger, fingers Manic Depression's captured my soul.  Woman so willing the sweet cause in vain, you make love, you break love, it's-a all the same when it's... when it's over.  Music sweet music, I wish I could caress, caress, caress. Manic Depression's a frustrating mess. Well, I think I'll go turn myself off an' go on down.  Really ain't no use me hanging around. Oh, I gotta see you.
0	I just heard something about one of my favorite singer/songwriter/guitarists, John Lardieri, who is soooo good.  He's playing a free show on a Friday night, somewhere in New Jersey. But its not till 9:30 pm, and I think it'd only be about an hour away. So I got all excited, I was sure I could convince somebody to drive me up there to see a great show. Then I read the bottom. 21 and over.  Damn.  Why, John, why?!
0	It's actually not going to work out, is it? It's like we're not meant to be together. I have work on Saturday, he has rugby on Sunday. We are so, so fucking fucked. I hate.............
0	I feel lost...  depressed...  empty...  void...  dead.
1	Well,       I heard that people were trying to convince government agencies (US) to ban the new genetically engineered glofish .  As a result I went out and bought 3 of them. Unfortunately that was all the store had.  They said they ordered 24 and got 6.  This is the home page of the glofish where you can se pictures.  They look about as good in person as in the pictures.     http://www.glofish.com 
1	Will be in the U.S. until the 15th of Feb. Updates will probably be even more sporadic than usual. Some of you I will see and/or speak to there.        graye   , I didn't get your CD done. Sorry. My time has been spent either at work or at the doctors'/hospital, chasing up my 4th ear problem of the month. One day, my fiend, one day.
1	So today was a good day actually. we didn't practice which was good because my abs were super sored. instead of that, we review strategies for our game tomorrow.  coach also gave us the surprise of taking us to see coach carter. it was my second time watching it n it's sad that i cried again. it was a good movie i thought, it might actually inspire us for our future games. highlight of my day=...got my braces off!! yay! it feels so weird n i hate wearing the stupid retainer. i can't talk n i sometimes feel like i'm about to throw up. i've never stuck my finger to provoke myself to vomit, but that's how it feels like. so anyways i have so much hmwk tonight n i forgot my books in my mom's car, how smart is that. ugh! got my cool report card today n i was rather sad. i got all a's n one b. i could've had an awesome g.p.a if it wasn't for precal. i'm so lost right now i'm a/b to do all the extra credit i can. i'm now leaving to find something productive to do.  nery
1	Everyone I've talked to is so excited about the engagement!  I'm so excited!!   It was kinda unexpected.  Like, we had breifly talked about getting married so I knew we were both thinking along the same lines.  I just thought maybe Valentines, Christmas, or our 1 year anniversary (I can't believe it hasn't even been a year yet!!)  We haven't picked a date yet, but we're thinking next October (because autumn is so pretty!)  A summer wedding would be nice too though.  So I don't know.  There's just so much I planning I'll have to do!!
1	so yeah i decided to be cool and make one of these. now im so ordinary!  its raining and it would be a perfect time for everyone to die, except for the few i love.  i really like the journal thing, it helps me get things off my chest!  i hate how people don't appreciate Brand New or The Smiths*  so make this a mix tape  I'm out, catch ya on the flip side fuckers
0	One of the things that pains me most about livejournal is having people I know go through difficulties, and not being able to be there to help them.  I want to help them to maintain perspective, see what is really going on, think positively on the future, and let them cry on my shoulder.  Mostly, just let them know that they are cared about no matter what.  you can't quite do that across the continent or the world efectively.
0	I love this story/poem...whatever it is...  A girl asked a guy if he thought she was pretty,  He said...no.  She asked him if he would want to be with her forever....  And he said no.  She then asked him if she were to leave would he cry?  And once again he replied with a no.  She had heard enough.  As she walked away, tears streaming down her face  The boy grabbed her arm and said....  You're not pretty you're beautiful.  I don't want to be with you forever.  I NEED to be with you forever.  And I wouldn't cry if you walked away...I'd die...   After being very upset today and realizing that all the effort we put into things should come out in return, and if not sometimes we have to move on... Some people just don't understand- make you upset- like Diana says,"Your worth more then that" ahaha I love u "d"

1	church was so great tonight, it's definately a nice way to end one week and start another.  i realized i've quit caring about a lot of things lately, almost everything.. and i don't even care about that either.  i don't know it's good or bad, and i don't care haha.  the people who matter most in my life know that they matter.. and school has become my top priority as it always should have been, and i'm getting a lot more involved with my church with is nurturing my spritiual sensitivy haha.  so as far as i'm concerned, the few things that actually matter to me right now are taken care of.. and everything is great, so i'm happy :)
1	Well, here is the weekend before exams starts. Well, I'm kinda glad, today's party was really a relax-zation before the exams. It was really fun, playing all those card games! *REFLEX!

So gay... need to make study notes for EVERY single subject. And what's even worst is the conflict thing, it sounds bad... but people say it's not...

Apparently it's a very pretty part of Scotland.  It's not a Munro.  It's a Corbett (smaller than a Munro) -and is 2759ft.   Ben Vrackie is nice to say.  It's not quite as tongue twisting as "Buachaille Etive Mor" -       laura_w    will be disappointed :-P
1	First, let me tell you all about the imagehost I use.  Imageshack  has not failed me with those insane little x's. Yet. The best part is they don't resize the image in any way. So, check them out. I love them a google times more than photobucket. Now to contradict myself, here is Aidan on photobucket. Shut up.    AIDAN HOPS!! AND ROLLS!! Yes, um I said hops. Yes, as in like a bunny. How fitting for easter, eh? It is adorable. I need pics of his new (2nd) haircut. It is really adorable.   And, on to what everyone really loves....  AIDAN!

Today has just been a relaxing day. Well if you minus the total stress which setting up my tv card caused me! I was trying to catch Rupert on RND 05 for the site, and I got the tv card working 2 mins before his part started 0_0  Andrew from Mugglenet is helping me with the clip now, its a huge ass 450 MB so we have to convert it, comress it and then post it :P Apart from that all's good.   Don't you just have McFly's Comic Relief song floating around in your head? If you didnt, chances are you do now ;)

After that, who knows, hanging out with Cari, catch up on old times with her, it's gonna rock       &nbsp;     So, free up your schedules ladies, cause I'm a coming       &nbsp;      &nbsp;

1	March 20th,2005  I have stayed in an ivory towel for a long time because I couldn't go out and faced the real thing and the my drawback.  For example, the lossing the competition for president for my club(AIESEC) is impact me a lot. Continuing in low motivation is cause me hate the job I did in AIESEC. Someone talked to me why you couldn't change your mind to find the reason I was lost. That is a key point that I have been afaid to face it. Therefore, I need to face it now. At this time, I got the motivation. I want to change me to be a good person.  Talkig with her is a good thing for me. She reminded me to go out from an ivory towel. I really don't want I  live in the past.

This is why I haven't put my all into school. When the outcome doesn't reflect the effort I feel so depressed.   Ok, I'm taking a nap and then doing my 215 prelab.

1	Lots has happened in the last few weeks. Lots. I have been struck and I have no idea what's going on. Totally oblivious of the world around me.  Without even realizing it, I had made the BIG decision of my life; so seamless ! Don't know how it happened, but it just did. Lost in thought, lost in time, lost my heart, my brains and everything else !!:)) A whole lot of mixed feelings. But nevertheless, I am really really excited. So much so that I am finding it hard to keep up w/ myself !   A whole new world, a dazzling place I never knew A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view Unbelievable sights, indescribable feeling soaring, tumbling, freewheeling, thru' an endless sky A whole new world, every turn a surprise, w/ new horizons to pursue I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare,  Let me share this whole new world w/ you...   :):):) (all smiles) signing off
1	So my mom and I started planning the baby shower. I didnt think that it would be so much work!  There is so much to do its unbelievable.  I've made out the guest list for the most part and the games and what not but we have to go register and get gifts for the games and whos going to cater and where its going to be.  Its so much fun :)  I still have to figure out everything I need and if I dont know what it is before the shower invites go out or everybody R.S.V.P's then Im just going to ask for gift certs for the people that do want to buy me clothes.  I can't wait I think Im going to have it the last weekend of March.  Chris' mom and I are going shopping Sat. morning to start getting little gifts and what not then I have to work so that sucks.  I haven't talked to Chris since tuesday because his phone is broke and I'm missing him like crazy, he's supposed to go get a new phone today but we'll see how that goes.  But I'm hungry so I'm going to go feed the baby in my belly :) xoxo
1	So I should have been in bed half an hour ago, but exactly half an hour ago I just realized that:  "OMFG SFHGKJdg hoafd fglOGsmgf gh  I CAN SCREENCAP  NEVERWHERE   .. AND MAKE ICONS!  sGHJKfhk sgjkshdajh dsa *insert fits of joy here*"   so. here i am. half an hour later, and i'm pretty much done randomly screencapping the first episode. TOMORROW.. I MAKE ICONS!   *glee*

0	I don't feel to good right now, I'm kinda depressed. I wanna talk to my love, but he seems busy. I'm getting bad pressure in my head. :S I wish i could find more to say...but i can't!!!  ~runs crying~  (i don't care kat!!!)
1	      wicked_wish    has started this meme and I hope all of you will keep it going.  Ganked from the Washington Post, of all places. Give me your life, in 100 words or less, any form of your choosing. Here's mine:  Born to a strange doctor in a place with a strange name. Movement was the theme of my early years. Lived 14 places before my third year. I had cats and dogs. I was happy.   Everything fell apart. Divorced ripped a hole in my existence.  Mother and I waved good-bye to the west.  We were Chicago girls, living with Mother’s parents.  I lacked friends. Mother lacked independence. Tennessee became our home. It changed us.   Mother found Bob. I found friends. We both found independence. After 16 years, school was left behind, almost.   I work designing for the university I attended.
0	That pisses me off...  For some reason I decided to dye my hair black again, and then I saw this purple highlight shit right next to it, so I decided to try that, too, but it doesn't look like it worked.  It MAY have on my bangs, but that's about it.  If it even worked there.  Oh well... I like my hair black.  I DON'T like my skin purple, though... hopefully I can take care of that tomorrow.  And hopefully tomorrow fucking flies past.  Anyway, I'm going to eat - again - and then pass out.  Not outrageous :(
0	today was one of the worst days of my unimportant little life. i've never had a day suck this bad...
0	MTV released a Bob Dylan cd.  MTV.  Why...does...MTV...Have...to...Taint...E verything...Good?  On another note, my dad just walked up to my clothes hamper, picked it up, and looked me dead in the eye and asked "Whats in here?".  How he's teaching I'll never know.

1	Long time since my last entry but it seems I live at this darned school!  Get this, my schedule:  9:00 am - Get up, shower, realize I´m late - run to work.  2-3 pm - Spend about 30-40 mins asking what everyone wants for lunch, order, eat around 5.  9:20 pm - Leave work, get home in about 45 mins. (Usually by taking awful subway rides with stinky people)   10:00 - Get home, change into PJ´s, eat light dinner (usually a quesadilla or yogurt with granola) talk to my cousins - go to sleep.  And that´s my life for the past three months.   I must admit, this new place is much better in regards to outings. I can actually go out now! I´ve recently been to a very en-lightening club... don´t ask &gt;&lt;,   Welps, that´s all for now, I´m at work so I gotta cut this short before Azu comes down.  *Hugs!*   Aishiteru!
1	I don't want to be here at school. I just want to go home and play the sims game and make my sims fall in love with other sims. I want to play that game so bad. If you know what I am saying. I am addicted to that game as you can tell beause I keep on talking about it. I am so happy that I am getting my homework done and I don't have to worry about it.
0	Anybody know what's going on with Nightscrawlers Forum?  I was in the path of Hurricane Jeanne and haven't had electricity for almost a week.  How long has the forum been down?  I certainly hope it was not hacked again.
1	Hi All, I know this is a bit late, but I've been running around getting the last minute details done.  Tomorrow, please assemble on platform FOUR of the main train station at 8.30am SHARP!   The seats on the train are assigned, but you can move... once... if you'd prefer to sit next to some one else for the journey.  Remember you can either buy a boxed lunch when it is brought through by the stewards or eat in the dining car.   The name of the ryokan is: Snow Flower Inn and the owners are Akira and Keiko Hanada. It's located five minutes away from the station and is very cosy! ^_^  See you all tomorrow morning!
1	woohoo :) (i seem to say that a lot lately)   http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/MTarc hives/week_2005_03_06.html#005562   Harry lookes really old on the "children"s version" of Bloomsburry ...   (I told you it was my lucky day ;))

1	 I'm glad i'm doing thise Cloisters of Trials again, since at the end of each one, i get a bunch of Spheres that i can put into empty slots of the Sphere Grid, and extra cut scenes with the Fayth. I also get to see what happened to the towns since the last time i was there, and what happened to Dona and Barthello.   Three down, three to go.

1	   8!       Days     Still I wish to find a way to say... That I never thought dreams could come true, And yet you've showed me that they do, Since you came into my life, Since the first moment when I saw your face, All these feelings washed over me, Like a storm of a rough tidal wave,  Against the rough shores, making me,  Open my heart, and soul, to only you, To let you know, that I want to, Let your soul take the lead, And this I promise in the core of me, Just kiss my lips with your sweetest taste  Of ginger wine, and let this love of ours be loose,  Since I feel this burning passion,  From your glowing glare, as I know  We are meant to be together,  Spark with spark,  Fire with fire,  Flesh against flesh,  As our boiling emotions enflame,  For ecstasy's survival,  Since you have set me on fire. - Lourdes S 
1	One of the advantages of liking classical music is that it's so damn cheap.  I picked up six new CD's today for $26.  Sweet.

1	of course i'll come. i don't hate Ben dude i just feel bad for him cause he is so very helpless and doesn't;t seem to ever grow (not in the up sense at all).  anyway i would like to see him and I'm sorry he broke up with Eliza i hope he does all right and I'm glad he broke up with Eliza cause she is one fucked up cookie.  gumbo is good and i shall eat as much as your nazi (i mean southern) mother will allow.  don't have pity friends Lizzy that's not a healthy basis for a relationship and i don't think i ever hated Ben.  i think i felt like he took a twelve inch nail and slowly beat it into my chest with a tiny tinker hammer over a long period of time and then dug around inside for kicks.  but there is a difference.  anyway this was gonna be a email but i like it so much its gonna be an lj. wee  a few words on gumbo(note a few is three so they shall be choice): chicken-sausage-spicey-goodness, happiness, mmmmm  P.S. chicken-sausage-spicey-goodness is one word so there!

1	Today my summer holiday is started. I'm really looked out for this this last week. This was also a very good excercise for me ;-))    Quote for today:  "Striving for the Inexpressible, the mind becomes completely clear.

0	sometimes, i look at little kids, and i get jealous. is that normal?  they look so happy. so innocent. not a care in the world. someone, take me back to those days, please?
0	Tonight the subjuct is very sad :(  I am one of those people that just wont stand by and let anything happen to my friends. If I see them hurt you can damn well know I am up on it. Sadly, I am learning, that my friends dont want my help per se. They want to do it themselves. This is very hard for me to accept on account of the fact that I want to get in there and be the hero. And they wont let me. I know I should just stand by and be the good friend, but i have a hard time with that because being the hero is my role. You know busting down doors, righting wrongs and stopping the bad guy. I hate the fact that I cant. Cause I want to help. I mean, just go in there and solve the problems. And they wont let me. I understand that they are wanting to do it on their own, but i hate that I just sit here and offer friendship. I hate it. SO MUCH I hate it. I want to kill the demons, right the wrongs all that good stuff.  Anyone got any suggestions.
0	Hardships. Starting my life over is becoming a very difficult task. I"m working very hard on my self improvment. Perhaps I should just cut myself off from everybody. Yes, perhaps that would best. I shouldn't be talking to anyone at this time at all.  Self improvment. What is that. Improvment from the inside out. Hmmm... Hopefully one day I will be the person that I want to be. For my sake, and my sons.
1	i've been doing that a lot lately..i have no idea why...*shrugs* i keep going BLAHHHH when i do it too...anyhoo..i'm talking to this DJ from y100 named alan...(he's super cute by the way) he's 23...hottttt!!! i asked him to play 311 for me cuz he likes 311 too! :) he said he would!! he lives in cherry hill...anyone up to stalking him with me??? seriously tho..check out this picture...   http://www.y100.com/weekenders.asp    *drools* alright..i'm gonna go...im gonna watch the movie of the novel i just read...time for me to get all disappointed..
1	I have been ridiculously busy.  As in ridiculously.  It almost hurts and it would if it weren't a great day to be alive.  The only real break I've had to this point has been watching the Red Sox, which is awesome to see the curse finally disappear.  I made it as an honor advisor which basically just means I'm there to provide information to people involved or potentially involved in honor proceedings at the University.
1	Well my small reading audience, here is the announcement we've been waiting on...I am officially moving Brad and myself to Augusta on the 18th or 19th. My last day with the Red Cross here will be the 18th. After that, it's BYE BYE ROME!!!    My new position is with the Cumbee Center to Assist Abused Persons (Aiken, SC) as a Sexual Assault Service Provider. It's going to be a tough, emotionally trying job, but one I feel I can do well. My first day there will be February 28th. God willing, maybe we will hear something on the house between now and then. That would just make the light at the end of this long tunnel a gazillion times brighter.   That's about all for me now. I hope to start updating more often again soon. Here's to you, to dreams, and to HOPE :)
0	nothing to say that i haven't said before so i'm not going to bore you all by&nbsp; repeating myself. i just wish i knew where i stand in the scheme of things. wouln't that be nice?
0	ok so since saturday i have been working on my mother fucking house. Im sooo tired of being home! get me the hell out of here some one any one there?
0	All I want is for life to go easy on me for a little while.
0	I got done about half of  the things I wanted to get done .  Remaining to tackle early this week:          make notes on  the paper , and write up a discussion paper for a class (due Thursday)   progress on a thesis outline (due Wednesday)   read/edit/brainstorm on a paper I've been asked to co-author (ASAP)   track down two missing corpora of English-language news articles about China (ASAP)   train various language model parameter families from said corpora (ASAP)   spend time with friends (whenever I can!)         
1	About to head out of work... then to run some errands and pack with Barry... I have to downsize my packing... I already have three bags full of stuff, and Barry and I want to take the three bags for both of us... so I have to be a bit more practical I guess.  After packing, we'll head off to sleep so we can be awake by 3:30am to shower and get to the airport by 5am.  &lt;sarcasm&gt;Whoopee!&lt;/sarcasm&gt; *grrrr* I hate early morning flights... but at least it's from ABE, so it's only a ten minute drive (yay!) Off to Florida for Easter and then a 5-day cruise...  Miami to Key West to Cozumel and back... Hopefully I'll have internet on the cruise to keep in touch... but if not, I'll catch ya'll up next week!
1	Just got a call from Dave Larsen. Yeah, the Dayton Daily News Dave Larsen.  He's connecting with Dayton people at Celebration 3, specifically the 501st, and wants a chance to chat with me and get some pictures.  Let's all pray Zam gets done, hmm? Isard is just not quite as cool.

0	I can't believe Jerrad is really leaving me. How could I let this happen? What the hell am I going to do...I've seen this coming for awhile, but it never really sank in. I'm depressed as fuck. I'm going to miss him soooo much...my heart is aching.
1	motion city in a week or so.  thats kind of cool.  i hope i don't miss them due to band.  damn you dan... damn you straight to hell... why must you miss rehearsal too on the only night i have something to do?  and that damn jazz fest... or maybe it's pronounced... yazz... im not sure... but yea... jd.. you are the man.  these speakers rock something hardcore.
1	So the other day I was searching for images on the web when I hit support vector machines (by mistake I think presuming I was doing web search). And lo and behold, I find images perfectly suited for making presentations on SVMs etc. They are images of the various equations which define SVMs. Anybody who's made a presentation involving equations knows how painful it can get. But now I've all the images available to me. (Yeah I know I can write a latex file for the equations, convert to html and then use the images, but it's painful as hell!). This is definitely gonna save me a lot of time.  I wanted to attend the O'reilly conference but can't 'cos am in India and can't afford to go to US. Was really dissapointed. But check what I found on  Russel Beattie's blog . A live commentary about some of the talks. Woohoo!
0	I'm watching the show 8 Simple Rules the one with John Ritter. Its an hour long special and in that episode the character paul has a heart attack or something while he's out getting milk. its so sad i am in tears.

0	Well Mary Kessinger died a few days ago. I'm getting ready to go to her visitation. She had a LONG LONG battle with cancer. This is like the 6the person I know die from cancer. I can't take all this death anymore. I lost one of my best friends in HS b/c of cancer jeez how many more people do I have to loose from fucking cancer. I have had enough. But anyways I loved Mrs. Kessinger she was an amazing lady. And for her and all my other friends that have passed away from this fucking disease at least they aren't in pain anymore. Even though it may hurt that they aren't around.. but everyone else can handle that kind of hurt. They were hurting far worse then I can imagaine. And nobody I knew ever ever ever complained ever.. they all just fought it and stayed positive. They are all my heros. That's enough said.
1	It's true that I keep the things that make me happiest to myself.  I whine a lot, I know, but trust me, I do have my happy moments.  While they're on the third tier, a good distance from the band, I do have a ticket to see U2 in October.  It's a side view, so I imagine I'll be seeing them at a similar angle as I saw Tool, and I should be able to distinguish them by their faces.  So unlike the ants that were *NSYNC, I might be able to tell Bono apart from Adam Clayton.  Nevertheless, I'll be there to dance to 'I Will Follow' and cry to 'Miracle Drug.'  This will be my first U2 concert.
1	Greetings from the community moderator/maintainer everyone! ^_^ We seem to have rounded up a large crowd thus far, and that's great because this community hasn't been open that long.  I'd like to inform you that I shall try to schedule a chat session for Sunday February 15th at around 8pm Central time. ^_^ I hope to see as many of you there as possible! &lt;3 Eve
1	i cant believe its finally happening...sigh, i love you frank.
0	Went to Hooters, then to Gilligan's with Don.  She wasn't there. =(  So Thursday night I'll be like "hey I was at Hooters Monday night but I didn't see you there."  And I'll ask her to the fair.   Eyes that shine burning red, Dreams of you all thru my head. 
1	We're getting out early ^_^.           I'll post more later.
1	Okay ... my me OTP ... I couldn't choose between me/Toppie and me/Ambs ... because Toppie owns me and I live in her head and I love her ... but Ambs is my fiancee ... soooo *crosses arms* I refuse to choose!  Hee...that rhymed!  And I think I have two non-me OTPs too ... Ellie/Satine, because I made it up :D and Tonnie/Toppie, like Alexa - because just dude! :D

0	well... i'm surprised that i was able to get online today cuz our internet at the school has been up and down a lot. &gt;&lt; Annoying, but anyways, here is the real news. Although it seemed like we would be keeping the kitten, my dad has decided that its time for us to give her away. I really don't want to, and i don't think that my mom wants to either, but right about now we have no choice. So.. I'm asking, if anybody knows someone who is interested in a cute Calico kitten named calli who has had all of her shots, but is not fixed, please let me know. Also, she is supposed to be an indoor cat, so yeah. If not then I'll have to think of something else. I want to give her to someone I know and keep in contact with on a regular basis, but I don't really know anyone who would want a kitten. So yeah... we'll have to give her away. =( That's the news.
0	The Barrelhouse is closed.  For those who don't know Cincinnati, the Barrelhouse was a brewery and restaurant that had the best stout and club sandwiches and pizzas.  I've seen too many good to great shows there, had my birthday there, met friends, negotiated jobs, had moments of clarity, written passages on napkins that were thrown away by my waitress, and so many other things I can't even begin to get them all down.  The guy who owned it was the greatest guy.  He was a part fo Cincinnati that people love.  He would support you any way he could.  If he couldn't give your organization money, he would give you a free beer tent or something like that.  He loved this town, and its people.  The part of me that wanted to stay in Cincinnati just got a lot quieter.  Take a moment of silence, and if you can, play "My Hero" by Foo Fighters.  Thank you.
1	The talent show was splended. (sp) and Neal rocked, and will be loved by many. and that is fun. :) then we went to biggies, and i drank coffee. and Megan was with us, and Carmen even came out. and that was wonderful. we had an outstanding time. Then me and Neal and Joel went to Jon's and played DDR. What a great night right? the only thing that hampers all this grand sweetness, is that i have mother trucking school tommorrow. :P, today should have been friday.   Anyways, dodgeball rocks.  And Nakajima is still a killer.
1	My Boogie no Jitsu will destroy all you pitiful peoples although I do fear Jill's natural athletic ability... And Dane's super flipping skills. Stef, Ryan, and Whitney should cower in terror from my Mad Boogie Skills. Yeah, I bought Stef's 6 boogie boards since i had some Paypal monnies. I am getting excited already. Oh and if anyone has a chance go take a look at the new RvB it is badass
1	Whenever I'm tired or depressed, I find it helps to spend a few minutes using Google Image Search to view pictures of cornball German 80s rapper Falco.           Ahh.
1	but the last couple of days have been awesome!! i don't think i failed my apchem or calculus tests. and capture the flag/sardines/running and leading some people in a really roud-about way to alex's house (we failed to beat him there. and everyone else got there way ahead of us. ah well. such is life.)  was so incredably fun. every friday night should be spent like that. and it's been bee-yoo-tiful outside too. steve's was fun although i ate way way too much. and texas hold-em, oh boy i suck at poker like no other. haha. and today. hw. ugh. and chores. more ugh. although walking w/alex (despite it being only for like 15 minutes) was really nice. i'd have to say that was the highlight of my day. i know it's only like 5:15, but i can tell you it's not gonna get any better.  and now that i've bored you all with ust a recap of my weekend, i should say something interesting. but that ain't gonna happen. maybe later.
0	 I Gave My Love a Kerry  (link to site with download for MP3 file)by Terre Roche. It would have seemed hopeful and strong before 2nd November: now it just seems sad, because Terre was wrong: ...Let's not trade our liberties for freedom from our fear The enemy that we perceive is not out there he's here But you are stronger than you think, America, my dear You are stronger than you think, America, my dear

1	Well, this time is going alot easier. There's plenty of jobs I can do out there for some reason, so I'm applying everywhere. Plus, I've still got enough money to entertain myself. So... uhh.. that's it. Go me. Oh, plus I just applied for a $13/hour job :D
1	yeah today was pretty boring...but i had a pretty good weekend.I hung out with jaime,jessica,and magdiel.i went to see ladder 49 with jaime and the movie was actually good,i thought it was going to be another Backdraft.I'm glad it wasn't though.This friday i'm  going to see brighteyes at the ridglea with jaime,jessica,magdiel,and angie and whoever else wants to tag along.I worked out today over my brothers house we did chest,back,biceps,and we ran 2 miles.It was pretty tough. i'm trying to get fit for firefighting and working a non physical job right now so i need the workout.I wish the hoods show was a different night because i am going to miss it.I heard there was going to be a lot of fights there anyway,and i am really in too good of a mood to fight right now anyways.my girlfriend always puts me in a good mood every time i talk to her or when i am with her.I love you Jaime Rochelle Roepke Baum.Thank you for everything.
1	 I got the  JtHM  book. I got the  Squee ! book. I haven't been this happy since...a long time.    Anyway, today was mall with  Sami . We did pretty much every fun thing there is to do. Treat Train = my new  favourite  place to be. We went to the 4-d theater, and I kept my glasses off, because I'm a coward, but the movie was more shock value than actually scary. And we did the Ferris Wheel, and that red thing where you get in and it simulates a roller coaster, and we were gonna do the D&amp;B Turbo theater, but it was closed. Had lots of fun.     Today's  RQotD  is a phrase. "multi-racial gummy utopia", which is now a functioning part of my and probably  Sami 's vocabulary. 
0	well today looks like a sad day i don't think im gonna do anything well i gtg bye
1	well, heres the rundown.  i lost my camera.  that why i havnt posted much latly, i feel like such an idiot, i jsut cant find it.  i have no idea what happened to it.  thats 400 dollars right down the drain.  and i have nothing to do, this is when id usually be taking pictures but i cant.  even though it really sucks that i lsot my camera.  everything else seems to be going really good.  i have the greatest friends, the greatest girlfriend, and my parents dont really suck that much.  you should listen to the jesus and mary chain, they are amazing, and my bloody valentine too.
0	   Somebody tell this to the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). Tell them to take a leaf out out of Dad's book...    By 9:15 am today, they had cut down at least eight full-grown trees near the race course, to accomodate the Anand Rao Circle fly-over... Many more should have followed by now.  Sad. All in the name of "development".
1	      Woohoo! Billie Joe first because I've never posted pictures of him before.

1	So today I got my Student Teaching Placement for next semester...  School: Valley View Elementary (AKA~The school where     Todd Platts & Dean Merkle send their kids)  Grade: 1st (Woohoo!!!)  Supervisor: DR. FREDERICKS!! :):):):):):):):):) (He definitely took care of me)   Am I happy? Estatic Am I nervous? Extremely Am I ready? Time will tell  The good thing is that I'm the ONLY one from York College student teaching here. What that basically could mean is that if they need to hire someone, and I do an awesome job, the chances of me getting the job are incredible!! :)

0	In light of certain ... recent events, I have decided that ... certain aspects of my personality may require ... reconsideration. To that end, I have arranged with Lieutenant Ford to join him on his next hunting trip, to  get away from you batshit insane people  get time away from other people.

0	 Oh my GOD.   Mitch Hedberg has been one of my favorite comedians for the past few years.  I'm quite upset about this.  May he rest in comedy peace.
0	RIP Sneakers.  You were a good dog.  A loud one, but a loving one.
1	We had a good time. Flowers, blushing, sandals flying through the air... hehe.  She wants to see me again. ^__________^
0	i hate hospitals. i hate having to be there.  break has gone for the worse, but then again it didn't start out great.  i need to find something to look forward to.  hell i'd settle for someone i could really talk to.  it's all bullshit anyhow.
1	Well, today I found out Kyle leaves for Florida on Monday. That's the only bad news I'll receive this weekend, I hope. Well tonight Crazy, Proulx, Kyle and Jackie came over. It was great! We played poker for like 2.5 hours. Jackie was a lot cuter than I remember as well, which is a great thing. The Pistons and MSU won tonight, so that was great. I had a great dinner the first night back. I am really feeling a lot better now which is awesome. So far so good. Now I must finish watching Conan.
1	did you know you can now have multiple cuts in a document?  You can cut a bit and then end the cut, like this   &lt;lj-cut text="see more"&gt; Hahaha there was nothing worth seeing   &lt;/lj-cut&gt; how good is that?!

1	That's right, I'm starting up the Hunters series again, though this time as a story rather than a comic - the comic will come later, once I am sure everything will be in place.  The RP will follow in 2-3 weeks; once I am out of school and have my summer schedule in place.
1	OH MAN today has been the best ever... well the best in a long time. IT was 62 out side today! I am so ready for spring. Even though i had work today and worked an extra 2 hours it still was a blast and plus i need the extra money. And then i get home and mother goes did you hear the news, and with me being half deaf of course i didnt. SOOO my fathers car broke a little and hes getting a new jetta tomorrow and i may be getting his old one!!!!(even though it needs like 1000 dollars woth of work)  well thats about it
1	hey seattle folk I will be up this from saturday night/sunday morning till the following saturday morning. I will be staying with       lisagail    except for however long I am at the ocean visiting grandma--usually just a day. mark your calendar now and keep the evening of friday april 22 in mind for maybe a largish social to-do at a local bar. or if you want me all to yourself at a given time,  email me !  so here I sit now wondering whether to do work or start preparing to leave two days in advance. I love preparing to leave but have felt something like a momentum for work just lately. I could do both I suppose.  more coffee will help

0	  Everyone remembers the 'faked-orgasm-in-a-deli' sequence from your kind of movie When Harry Met Sally. It seems that you're falling for a buddy or have already fallen for them. Uh-oh. You're probably caught between the possibility of having a great relationship and wrecking the one you have now. You know what they say, it's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do.       What Romance Movie Best Represents Your Love Life?     brought to you by  Quizilla    SO TRUE!
1	HAPPY 20TH BIRTHDAY to  PHONA   Hope you have a good day sweetness. I know I sure will :D
0	Have just had the weirdest urge to write a creative writing.  Finished what I had to read for History and English. YEEEEEES. And its only 7:05, I am on a roll! Now I just have to clean my bed off so I can go to sleep early tonight...  Now, when someone tells you that one of the only reasons they get on the IM is to talk to you and then they suddenly aren't getting on the IM any more, what does that tell you?  Garrrnaf.  I hate being a girl.
1	to day i helped w/ Skye's rental property and afterwords we went out to eat the 3 of us and we proceeded to sing and have a grate day.  we sang the entire hour home :D, i enjoyed watching my pretty skye sing ::warm smile:: i hand so much fun. mostly i was listening to eric and skye because i did not the words and i am not the best singer... but i still tried.. it was fun to have eric sing.  he is a really good singer and i enjoyed the two of them having a grate time singing to Billy Joel.
1	It's ridiculous how excited I am to be here for the kids' Christmas. I couldn't even tell you how long it's been, but it's been a hell of a lot of years.  Though it does look like a wrapping paper factory has exploded all over the living room.  What can I say, I can resist buying things for them. Or for Eric.  Speaking of Mr Studious, I can't tell you now evilly fun it is to do all I can to distract him while he's studying.  What can I say, I revel in being grade A pest.
0	Well, I'm quite sick and rather depressed. I think turning emo is possibly the worst thing that could happen to anyone, so I'm not going to use this lj to rant about my shitty life. Because in reality, it's going fairly well, and I have very little to complain about at all.  Maybe it was because everyone was drinking last night and smoking up and I wasn't, or maybe it was because of my near-feverish state of nature, but I felt just this incredible wave of depression sweep over me. I couldn't get rid of this feeling that everyone on my floor was hooking up with everybody else except me, and that I was completely and utterly hopeless romantically-wise. Sigh. I'm such a fucking loser.  Sorry to post this. Just ignore it.
1	If there is one person you can't stop thinking about, post this exact same sentence in your journal.  
0	Bleh... So, I was talking to this un named person online, who I had a suprise for, and some pretty cool news to share, and they were supossed to call me... said they werent going to be home til late, but its already 3:15 am... kinda disapointed, because I think they are sleeping right now... eh, oh well. Now I dont even know if im going to share the news, because I was al hyped up about it, but unless they call soon, ill probably just forget about it. Other than that, college is goin alright. I am enjoying myself. Poor Jamie was heartbroken today, I feel so bad for him... I hope he feels better! Anyways, I guess thats it for now! Talk to you all soon!
0	Hey everyone.  I feel so confused about everything. I tried to write a happy poem yesterday but the words wouldn't come to me. I mean all I do is write sad, depressing things but it really helps to get your emotions out. I'm sorry if you don't agree with me. I saw my doctor today and I think it made me realize some things. I have a not so great home life. Well he kinda made me realize that and he got me to talk about it. I know it has always been the problem but I didn't want to admit it to anyone and I probably won't tell anyone because I know they have their own shit to deal with. love you all
1	So the blahness reigned supreme despite all my efforts yesterday.  Until . . . after my last class, I went to Staples to get supplies for a poster I have to make, and blasted Lauren's Valentine's Day CD.  I'd done so before with no effect, but I suppose the stars were in alignment and all, for before I knew what'd hit me, I was  HAPPY BABY!!  and rockin' out like there was no tomorrow.    When I got home, I spent an hour trying to get laid in Fable, to no avail ::sniffles::.  Then, on Gilmore Girls, Luke and Lorelai got back together!  *dances*.  I called my Mom to celebrate and she got uber pissed at me for not taping it for her . . . ~_~'.  Only one class today, then I get to see Kintaro ^_^.  Two midterms on Thursday to study for though . . . &gt;_
1	First and most importantly, happy birthday to       joyfulgirl41   , who totally lives up to her name.  Secondly, how much do I love the "summarize in 20 sentences" meme? I'm still playing with it (I've got a lot of fic), but here's what it did with Kodachrome.   17 parts reduced to 35 words: "Lex!" "God, Lex. "Lex!" "God, Lex. "God, Lex. "God, Lex. "Lex!"  "Fuck, Lex. "Damn, Lex. "Thanks, Lex. Fuck, Lex. "Fuck, Lex. Thanks, Lex. "Lex!" "Fuck, Lex. "Hey, Lex? "Lex, Lex! "Clark? "Thanks, Lex. "Thanks, Lex.   That about covers it, right?    Edited to fix birthday girl's name. 'Oyful' is entirely different from Joyful:)
0	You know what disgusts me?  Somewhere, some asshole fuckbag piece-of-shit worthless scum of an excuse for a man just raped an innocent girl.  It makes me sick that there are people out there that call themselves men, and make me ashamed to be the same gender as them.

1	 I did some photos for the lovely Simon from Gus Guitars (www.gusguitars.co.uk) a while back and haven't really looked at them till now. Industrial Bitch (www.industrialbitch.co.uk) is a stunning model and such a wonderful person to work with and       imaginary_boy    and i always have so much fun when we shoot together so this was a really easy shoot for me.  Im pretty happy with the photos, hope you enjoy them too.                    
0	*is having an uber fat day today*  &lt;---i am beyond depressed...if the gym were open...i would go...  Depressed too.  I wanted today to be fun.  We did jack.  So I'm fat, alone, and I don't feel good enough.
1	I am at school AIH YAY fun, I have to go to work to day not looking forward to it but it is a good job. I am thinking of kaet right know.
1	Melvin finally opened up to me about the situation with Stephanie and the kids last night. I'd been waiting patiently for him to vent because I knew he would when he felt like it. By the end of our conversation he seemed to be feeling a little better. I know it's gotta be hard for him living in that big house by himself. Not being able to kiss his kids goodnight and all that. I just hope it all works out and he feels better soon. Back to himself. I really just hope he's not bitter about it. Today was a better day for Melvin. For that I'm happy.
1	I borrowed the office digital camera this weekend, so I finally have some new pictures of my lovelies, Linus and Schroeder. Here's Linus admiring himself in the bathroom mirror --       More Linus. He's such a cuddle-slut. Heh.    Sitting at the kitchen table.     Lounging on the bed with his brother.     Schroeder checking out the bathroom.    Schroeder hiding in the corner.     Sleepy Schroeder.     He has a bit of a recurring problem with feline acne, as you can see here. I recently switched their water dish to a stainless steel bowl, so I'm hoping that will help clear it up. He hates those medicated wipes the vet gave up, so I don't use them often.     And a couple of older pictures, because these don't show the true blueness of their eyes.        Cross-posted to       kittypix    and       ragdoll_cats   . Apologies to those of you seeing this more than once.
1	this weekend was good minus friday when i was sick, saturday i got to sleep until 10 and then i went with my dad and joe to get a christmas tree and we decorated that and then i went to work. where i worked with my cousin Terri, who told me she was pregnant... very exciting news seeing as though her sister, Jill, announced she was pregnant a few days before. terri is due July 8th and Jill is due august 1st. two new cousins in one month very exciting. then after work chris and i went to see the grudge. scariest movie ever i think i overed my eyes for the whole movie. today i worked with terri again until 1 and then went to kayden's birthday party where i saw my whole entire family...joy and now im going over to anne's for dinner and then ill come back here (my dads) and do my homework i didnt finish thursday night cause i got sick and thats about it so that was a pretty good update  xoxoxo
1	but thats ok, because i love alexi and its a good icon so mucho props to that kid on myspace who made it lol.  anyways, had a wonderful weekend.  Saturday went out with gia and bj to bound.  much to my surprise i actually had a good time.  it was fun bothering rob all night.  yesterday, hung out with my sweetie, had some chinese food and watched some iron chef.    what was that rich? you want your ass pierced? lol.  ok, i need lunch and i need to start getting ready to head out woot!
1	I'm an aunty again, for the 2nd time in 4 months.  This time I have my first (biological) nephew.  Matthew has joined us.  :-D  Lindyloo
1	I was reading through some fairly mundane, boring documentation just now, when I came across this:     * Standard login     If your user name is "buffy" and your password is "slayer", then the command:        cfg-summary -u buffy -p slayer -s dlserver        (which is equivalent to "cfg-summary -r "buffy:slayer@dlserver")    etc...  And it made me chuckle. Especially because I was listening to Tool's - Third Eye at the time, a song about altering your perceptions and seeing past the rules and order of society to find yourself afraid in the face of uncertainty and chaos...  I found it to be a refreshing, subversive example. Even if it  is  a terrible, stupid show. :)
1	Today is the start of FurCon! o,o         ...MORE INFO WHEN I GET BACK ON MONDAY! PEACE Y'ALL! :D

1	Oh my god. I'm in the best mood I've been in in longer than I can remember. It's amazing.
1	So, I had my schedule change form all filled out and I was ready to switch from Physics to Senior Release...and then I go into the classroom and meet Mrs. Shields. And she's so energetic and she's talking about how only the best students take physics and how the entire class is such a great experience and how soon we'll be more like colleagues than teacher & student anyways and how great it is that there are only 11 people in the class, and all of a sudden I didn't want that schedule change anymore. Damn good teachers and their making me want to come to class.
1	1. me and nicole are going to go ... look at the incoming frosh. yes, yes we are. don't ask. 2. i've decided that me, marla, and nicole are going to buffalo. just because. oh wait, actually because nicole has never been there. 3. i get to see mi amor/lobster-in-arms/sidekick/sensei on sunday. actually we still have to talk about that. 4. also, just the fact that we have the weekend off is a top ten worthy reason in itself. 5. i get to sleep in my own bed. and you wouldn't even believe how AMAZINGLY comfortable my bed is. i swear to god it's beautiful. ok well i think there are only a top five reasons, so if five more top ten worthy things come up this weekend i'll be sure to let you all know.  god i am so SMOOTHHH ... really i am. if you're my lobster-in-arms and you're reading this i need to tell you about the SMOOTHHH-ness of what i did today.  oh and i know what i think of him. &lt;33* always

1	i am in a good mood today!!!! have a sleepover tonight, i just came back from a bookfair, and i just made myself a new icon. oh, and i took a cool Quiz. yay, here is my result:  You're a "Pink Angel". Now, just because it may be a little bit of a feminin color doesn't mean you're all girly and whiney. You're very self-less and love to bring good news to people because you like seeing people happy. You have better manners than most and people love how polite you can be. You're friends love that they hardley ever get in arguments with you and can barely get mad at you! You're friends and family mean so much to you and it takes more than a fight to break you away from them      What Color Angel Are You? (ANIME PICS)     brought to you by  Quizilla

0	It is Easter, so I shall post an appropo poem by Don Marquis, my favorite poet.   The Nobler Lesson  Christ was of virgin birth, and, being slain, The creedists say, He rose from death again. Oh, futile age-long talk of death and birth!-- His life, that is the one thing wonder-worth; Not how He came, but how He lived on earth. For if gods stoop, and with quaint jugglery Mock nature's laws, how shall that profit thee?-- The nobler lesson is that mortals can Grow godlike through this baffled front of man!
0	   it was taken in the bathroom at this reception hall.  it was a lounge and a bathroom, but a bathroom mirror none the less.

Good times were had by all, though I seem to have injured my knee due to an accident I will detail further during an update tomorrow.  It was a very eventful trip back, followed by a very relaxing time after arriving here.  I'm in a damn good mood...  MAJOR CHUNKO UPDATE TO FOLLOW SOMETIME TOMORROW

0	Well, I got stood up last night.  :(  I was supposed to go to watch a movie with the dude who lives across the hall from me.  Looks like there goes somebody to talk to.  I've decided it's best that I don't deal with ppl who pull that kind of shit on me.  But oh god, I really don't need this now.
0	So today adam moved back in with his mom. I miss having someone there with me, yet enjoy having time alone... hard to explain. I totally cleaned my room, and moved shit around.  for some reason when i get on AOL on my mac, it will freeze up when ever i try to open up a page.

He added me to his messenger list :D My rents are happy becuz I'm getting better grade now in my school work. They've really been nagging about it becuz next year etc is really improtant yaddah yaddah yaddah!
0	I hate it when certain things I have been looking forward to begin to unravel and start slipping through my fingers. Life has this way of complicating or getting in the way, and due to no fault of my own, I might have to let go of certain things I was really looking forward to.   It's really frustrating, but I suppose it is the waxing and waning of life.   What matters is how you roll with the punches, right?
1	home today! umd emailed me back about the application fee, so i feel better.  wait for whats next. boathouse! april 30! come visit if you like. i should be packing. sin city!!!!  i cant wait to see how much longer my hair is. teehee. i like making people blush.
0	Feeling depressed for some unknown reason.  There's probably something about this place, living with this bunch of people or it is just  me  who is the culprit.   Or maybe I just miss home, miss the way Pa, Ma, Chuan and I sit down for dinner together and fight for remote control.  And I miss my dogs. *sobs*  I haven't seen Kuro-chan for   so   long... How big has he grown now ? Does he  still  come in and sit on the door edge in that silly way of his and wag that naughty tail ? And bark at me ?   Would I still be a part of the family now that I've moved ?   Is that why I'm feeling pretty anti-social now ?  Like I want to crawl into some small place and stay there, hugging Rhia.   I would like to thank the Gods up above for giving me  Rhia ...   So I thought some happy therapy would work. Dug out old emails from Akiko to read since her emails always make me so happy. Somehow it didn't work that way because I...   ...just started crying.   I'm so  useless.      I  hate  myself...
1	I am in second hour waiting for fourth hour cuz we are going to Dayton,Ohio.I cant believe it is here already i am so excited but scared at the same time cuz there is gong to be 30,ooo people ahhhhhh!I also cant wait for the bus ride cuz we always have a lot of fun on the bus.Well g2g!
0	 Hunter S. Thompson  took his life this weekend. So sad.  Hunter was one of the names I had picked for Zoe if she were a boy. Hunter, Quentin Keough, Connor or Xander.     Dan wanted Ian Malcolm so that the baby would be I.M. Large but I digress. That's not the purpose of this post.   Farewell Hunter. May you find peace.
1	Hanging out with Andy, Amy, and Claire these past few nights have been amazing to say the least. Freakking great people, all around class.  I have a date for formal now, so that is pretty sweet, even though I kinda knew she'd go, but let's not discuss too much...  Life is great. Let's see where this goes.  -Pun
1	Just ate some mac and cheese with Ali. Shes a great girl. I am glad shes fitting in, and that she feels at home. We all need to have a place to call home.  Rogue and I are going to a movie later. We will call back to the mansion to check in. We will be very careful.

0	I am sad.  I am also pathetic. Hey look, livejournal changed.   Yes, I watched the debate last night.  Yes, I will watch all of them.  No, I still don't like politics.  That is all.
0	I have been checkin my mail every 10 minutes for the last 24 hrs, i didnt sleep for long last night, i havent had anythin to eat in the last 48 hrs, and in addition to that I got drunk last night .....................  ummmmmmmmmmmmmm I just wish I can talk to her   Later
0	 "The angels welcome you."        I stayed up until 6:30 am, but of course it happened when I was asleep.   I wish I had some great words to say, but right now I'm at a complete loss. There's an emptiness, a sadness but also a profound relief that at least he could go with some dignity and swiftness, that his suffering is finally over, and that he won't have to become a Terri Schiavo political puppet.  Catholics, both active & lapsed, my prayers go out to you.
1	Today was awesome!!!  I was up on time and able to do a little work before I headed up to campus.  Valerie didn't feel good in the morning.  I could tell because she kept furrowing her brow, she does that when she doesn't feel real good.  I went to classes, which was entertaining.  Then I went to pick up Valerie and walk her to clogging.  She had a headache and her nose hurt.  I went to my Brother's house with Val.  We put a puzzle together with Karen and Makayla was a slow warming up, but by the time it ended she gave Valerie a hug and she cried when we left.  It is hard to see her cry.  We went to 15 and watched Alias.  Val was sleepy and I went home.  Anyhow, now it is time to go to sleep.

1	I'm back! But I have been for a couple of days. Just haven't had the time and rest and peace to write an LJ entry. ^^; I'm bad. I know.  I had a very very nice time; I met lots of new people, had major fun, made pretty walks, had a good time with my cousins (who were there too, yes), played pool (and I'm now decent at it!), played table tennis and volleyball and more, and gained weight. So I'm going on a diet! Yay for me. I feel fatty now. &gt;_&gt; But at least I had a nice time! Maybe I'll write a LONG entry when I'm bored. But not now- busy!  Am going on 'zomertour' tomorrow, with Kris and Elise. Amsterdam, Utrecht possibly... we'll have to pick some more destinations, but fun is guaranteed, even though the weather will be bad. We'll just ignore the horrible Dutch weather. :)  Okay, so I'm off to get my junk together. Cheerz!  (Latest DevArt Submissions;  http://eldarwen.deviantart.com )          
0	I had to delete Return of the King cause my computer didn't have enough memory.  My computer then proceeded to die on me.
1	 I am really looking forwards to seeing       adamnedsoul    's face tomorrow when he sees his surprises.    There was gonna be other surprises too but stuff changes and I think it's&nbsp;all for the best. :D    I also hope he's having a great trip with gorgeous Tasha, Giovanna, Niobi and Gino and I know he will find his adventure fantastical.     Happy Birthday mate! 
0	I miss my sister. Mum found one of Eliza's old flannel shirts in the cupboard and it smells like her.  That is all.
0	Well - I'm grounded during the weekdays on the computer, I'll be on during the weekends - it's becasue I have a 75 in a class, that's all. I can still get email (Chandra80D@charter.net) through the school computers.   I'm cross-posting this to all the LJ communites I'm in, so - bye!
0	monday...just sucked.  for work i got to talk to more than one thousand assholes, (no...i'm serious, i literally spoke, briefly, to thousands of people, not all of whom were terribly nice) got sunburned, then went to j&h's that evening.  club sucked. it was a tomb, virtually no one i knew for that matter, no one really talked to me, i had to  walk home from downtown to clifton.   the walk home was probably the  highlight of the whole day. it took me a little less than an hour to walk  home.    i guess i was hoping for a better day.  anyway, would anyone like to do coffee sometime this week? perhaps even  tonight?
1	THE DEMO IS FINALY FUCKING DONE!!!! it actually sounds really good i think very professional. Not bad for five guys who've been together for about a month or somethin and recorded it in a basement and mixed it on a pc. I'm actualy very proud of it. I have no complaints about the way my voice sounds and the music sounds really good. there's just very minor flaws in some parts but hey we aren't pros and didn't go to a studio so oh well. I wanna try to put 'em up on the net some how so people can hear them or at least figure out how to send one or all of them in an e-mail. If anyone wants to hear it or has an idea how i can get 'em up on the net or send them to people let me know.
0	so true....at times...           You Are From Venus             You love all forms of beauty. You love dressing up and anything luxurious. A social butterfly, you're incredibly popular and a great host. You're known for your fairness and affection. And as a frind to all. Careful though! You're desire to please may make you too willing to conform. Be yourself. Focus on what matters to you. You'll be all the more popular for it.         What Planet Are You From?   
0	well i dont know what to say other than, im speechless. im still trying to recover from the shock, of what happened. i mean i was waiting online for a couple of days for him to tell him that i was going to come up there and see him and hangout like the old times, except that time will never come now. how someone can be so stupid as to kill someone over money is ridiculous, i mean serioulsy since when have we been able to put a price on another human being. thats all i can say about that im not ready to talk about it.  today was another bad day not only did my stats test go horrible, but i showed up to law class and guess what we had a test in that and i thought it was on thursday so i didnt even read the chapters yet.... yeah i think its going downhill and i need tto drop the gear and pick up speed the pace. and on friday is my accounting exam yeah def. gonna start reading for that today! im gonna nail on of the test on the head so i can at least try and save my GPA........BET
0	I think that I have hurt or upset the one true person I spend time with.  Someone that I get to talk to in person, not just over the computer.  And I am not sure as to what I have done, but it is tearing me apart inside.  I want to make it up to them, but I'm not sure how.  I want to see them so very badly.  *sighs*  Maybe I'll surprise them with an unexpected visit.  If not tonight, then one night this week.  I can't stand the silence, the seperation.  I fear I am losing my mind.
0	I thought swimming was goin good, but now i jus wana tell boyle to go fuck herself.
1	Hey hey! I have returned from the boonies! I just wanted to say that I was back, and if you feel the need to e-mail me and say "welcome back" feel free! Well I can say I am definately happy to be back to civilization. However, I am very scared, Because Kate emailed me and gave me up new gossip from Slone's and 3 people (two of them I know and work with a whole whole lot and know well) got fired. It's thrown off my reality! You can't DO that! Not to Amanda! ahhhhhhh. Anyway. Love you all. It's great to be back.

0	 my head hurts. my neck hurts. my back hurts. my stomach hurts. my legs hurt.    math test tomorrow, i'm pretty positive that i'm going to own it. that means WHAT? liberation, what else? that's a lot of pressure.    i haven't been alone with my boyfriend since monday night.     i'm about to lose my mind. oh,&nbsp; wait, i've already done THAT too.    i want a darvocet and a ride to calc club/school tomorrow morning.    &nbsp;    i love my joey soooooo much and can't wait to see him tomorrow night. :D  
1	Woohoo!    Went to see K, my ob, yesterday...    .  No dilation yet, but she said the cervix was softer.  If I haven't gone into labor on my own by Friday evening, we're off to the hospital to start induction.  She's going to start with something like Cervidil (a prostoglandin suppository), which makes me feel better as I've heard that Pitocin can be rather harsh.  We'll go in about 7:30 and if nothing has happened by morning, we'll move on with a low dose of Pitocin.  I don't think we're going to get that far though as I noticed a tiny bit of brownish spotting last night that's continued this morning.  Hopefully that means I'm on my way on my own and won't need to be induced.  Anywho... looks like we'll have a baby in our arms by this weekend sometime, and that's so incredibly exciting. :)
1	On a more positive note, I'm at work making extra money today!  Yeah for that!  It's always nice to get a paycheck which is more than the norm.  Now, I can treat myself to a few nice things.  That makes me feel good.  After, I leave here, I'm going to do a little cardio at the gym, tan, go to the grocery store, and CLEAN my apt.  It needs a good scrub down today!
0	I don't know what to think. She's drinking  Cole 's pure-evil tonic. I tried to convince  Cole  that striking a compromise with the forces of good by releasing  Phoebe  is in everybody's best interests, but the superstitious fool kept going "I'm evil, I don't compromise, I serve  The First ". Storming the penthouse is likely to get  Phoebe  killed, and nobody wants that. I feel so helpless.
1	So my am client called and canceled.  However she apologized, wanted to reschedule and told me she had done what I suggested 2.5 weeks ago and it had make a marked improvement.  I am over the moon.  I love when people can use me to help themselves and it is a large step when folks remember what I said that long ago let alone put it in practice.    smile
0	I use to care now i dont. i use to love but now i dont have enough to give. There are people i think that care for me. But they dont show it off. There has to be some one that has LOVE. FOR ME. I wish could just see it. But i cant. I wish i could just know it. But i dont. I wish i felt it. But i havent. I wish there was. But i dont think there is. ANY MORE.

1	Good day today...Early Release.  I've been hyper like all day.  Went over Veggie's after school.  Bought this awesome bracelet she made.  It reminds me of my tiger spirit from the Chinese Zodiac.  I stayed to watch Hero's Legacy which it took us an hour to find only to realize it had stealthily hidden in her backpack.  Then not being technologically L33T!  Ha I spelled L33T!  We tried to use the DVD player... *Scratchs head and kicks it!*  We had fun though...   It's also official I've been fully converted to the dirty minded teenager I always was on the inside!  Veggie knows what I'm talking about.    Kat I got your message.  I will be looking for more books on Saturday at our town Library.  But I'm glad you found some.  ^_^  Lost my train....
1	yesterday I've worked my legs out of my body, damn working is tough!

1	I am rescinding my application for Naropa's Summer Writing Program in order to divert all of my funds into a California trip with the boy.  Today I walked into the organic food store formerly known as Mrs. Erb's to see if I still had a job (on account of the new management and all). Lucky for me I have always been on of Chef Frank's favorites and apparently these days he's in charge of the schedule. He pulled me aside and said "You've been spared" which made me giggle. Also, he said he'd be able to put me on double shifts in the summer, so I can spend the better half of my week living with Johnny-Boy in New Brunswick &lt;3 Yep, were going to live together...I feel so mature.  I bought a little anchor charm today that I am going to make a necklace out of. Everyone always compliments me on the necklace I made with Jake's old ring, so I figured now that Jake is out of the picture I should probably stop wearing it. Johnny has an anchor tattoo so I figured it'd be cute.
1	 hey hey hey!! im going to ulta today and they are gonna pour hot wax on  my face and rip it off with a little rag, now thats MY idea of fun. Emu  just left, he said he was going to find a job, woopie. anyway im making  pizza, yum, i took it out of the freezer and put it in the oven ALL BY  MYSELF!!! im such a good cook. im talking to my knitten kitten on the  phone and she's talking aboot how much she "hates me", thats ok... i  forgive her... i guess i just wont be paying for her manicure today at  ulta.

0	Sometimes I just want to be alone. Spend time with myself. Just get away from everything. It’s funny I guess, cos I’m the kind of person who hates to be alone, I’ll go mad. Like I hate it when I have to lunch alone. But then again, I think the mundane things of everyday gets to me. I just wanna get away.  I’m really looking forward to gg back s’pore, not becos I miss my home (which of cos I do). But the primary reason is becos I want time to myself. I want to think. I dun want to be tied down by activities, things to do, things to see. I want time to reflect, ponder. Where my life is heading, what can I do, how to I do it. I guess it’s sth like soul-searching?  I want to laze ard, not wanting to have a hectic lifestyle. Sth like the entry written by HY.
1	 For years I have been searching for the perfect watch.&nbsp;     I at last found it.         The Casio WVA-450TDJ-2AJF is brand new, and only available in Japan.&nbsp; I had to get it imported.&nbsp; But is is SO super cool, and it is everything I ever wanted in a watch.    It is solar powered - never charge it, wind it, shake it, or anything.    It syncs to the atomic clock signal in Denver - you never need to set it and it is always accurate to within a second.    It has an attractive analog face, but also a small digital readout for world time, stop watch, and other good stuff.    It is titanium with a saphire crystal, and waterproof way deep.&nbsp; Darn near indestructable.    AND -- it looks great!&nbsp; :-)    I love it!&nbsp; I couldn't be any happier with my new toy.    Now I am a watch geek too!&nbsp; :-)    &nbsp;&nbsp; - chris 
0	Just got back from my usual once a month Sunday morning IHOP breakfast with my Dad. I guess this will be our last for awhile. He is leaving for Afghanistan next weekend. He will be working for Halliburton. I am very worried about the whole thing but it's a done deal. All I can do is think positive about the situation but even as I type there are tears. I just think it all so unnecessary. But he doesn't. When he returns he can retire. He has worked very hard over the years. It will finally be time to hang up the tool belt. Anyway, he will be gone one year with two week vacations every 90 days. His vacations will be in random places like Germany or England. Anywhere but the United States. Ya don't get paid once you hit US soil. So, it looks we all need to get passports. Sigh. 2005 is going to be one crazy year.

0	I keep thinking of the audience the late Pope gave a group of young breakdancers ~smiling~ he kept making these hand gestures that pontiffs often make but when you watch it it looks almost like he's "raising the roof" and giving props. Well, I guess he was giving props.  Being a student of history, of the both the Holy Roman and Greek Orthodox Church...of wars and revolutions...  ...I can truly appreciate a Pope who gave an audience to and enjoyed teenaged break dancers.

1	It looks like I'm going to make it to Sarah's wedding afterall.  Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was very dissapointed when Keryn decided she wasn't going, and even more dissapointed when Becka dropped out of the road trip proposal, but as it turns out Stacie and Lauren are going to be there and it looks like I can hitch up with them.  Haven't seen them since, um, graduation?  So that will be fun to catch up.  Oh I'm so happy about this turn of events.  Weddings are just important events to attend, I feel.  Having no money, while a legitimate reality, is not a valid excuse in my opinion.  Memories are so much more valuable.  Right, so tomorrow I'm DEFINITELY starting to study for finals.  No excuses.  Does anybody want to go see  ani  with me?

1	Today is a beautiful, bright sunny spring day.  It's gorgeous.  So changes.  I no longer exclusively rely on the TTC or my feet to get around.  I bought a bike.  It's wonderful.  Not pretty, but it does the trick, will get me around.  Oh yes, and its a pushbike.  Havn't ridden one of those in nearly a decade.   Man, do my legs hurt.

1	Well, beat the drum and hold the phone - the sun came out today! We're born again, there's new grass on the field. A-roundin' third, and headed for home, it's a brown-eyed handsome man; Anyone can understand the way i feel.  Chorus: Oh, put me in, coach - i'm ready to play today; Put me in, coach - i'm ready to play today; Look at me, i can be centerfield.  Well, i spent some time in the mudville nine, watchin' it from the bench; You know i took some lumps when the mighty casey struck out. So say hey willie, tell ty cobb and joe dimaggio; Don't say "it ain't so", you know the time is now.  Chorus  Yeah! i got it, i got it!  Got a beat-up glove, a homemade bat, and brand-new pair of shoes; You know i think it's time to give this game a ride. Just to hit the ball and touch 'em all - a moment in the sun; (pop) it's gone and you can tell that one goodbye!  Chorus Chorus Yeah!
1	Hey springsea and innerslytherin and anyone else who might be interested, did you know that they're making a Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movie?

1	   What an awesome weekend this was! So busy but it was really fun!         Drumline was so incredabily awesome! We got moved up to open class and ended up with fifth place! And I had so much fun with everyone.&nbsp; I can't wait till we go to Nashville.&nbsp; It's going to be so much fun.&nbsp; Good Job to the battery and pit you guys did so well! &lt;3        It sucked that i had to wake up and go to work&nbsp;on Sunday but luckily I only had to stay for an hour because we were dead and he knew how tired and sickely I was feeling.&nbsp; And then&nbsp;I did a little Valentine's Day shopping! Went and saw&nbsp;Hitch with the family (it is really&nbsp;good&nbsp;I recommend everyone going to see it!). When I got home Paul came over for awhile (which is a perfect ending to any day &lt;3)        Happy Valentine's Day in 10 minutes! &lt;3

1	I'm so excited!  Superfly is no more!  That is the name that my brother-in-law and sister used to call my other car! I hated it!  Anyway, I bought a 2001 Chevy Monte Carlo.  It's silver with black leather interior, moon roof, compus, power everything and On star!  The only thing it didn't have that I wish it did was a cd player.  I figured that I could always add that later though.  I was a bit nervous when I was signing the paperwork.  I just kept saying to myself "It's only money, it's only money!"  Money of course that I will be paying back for the next 4.5 years!  Oh well!  I needed a car badly.  Now I can actually go places.  I was too afraid to even drive to Sandy's house in Rockford my car was so bad.  Drinks on me today, as long as their cheap, I have a car payment to make now! LOL
1	I don't know if I could be any more confused today.  I really honestly don't have a complete handle on everything I've written, talked about, attempted to install, etc.  I hereby banish myself from the computer for the remainder of the day.  Or at least Livejournal. :-P
1	Well, I missed it by a couple of minutes, but it was Pi Day yesterday (March 14).  I had a great time today with the Mass in Time of War performance.  I think it went really well.  Unfortunately, I'm really tired now so I'm not going to write much.  Coming up is my last full day of classes.  Then, I start finals.  Huzzah!
1	...I just realized that I'm rooming with Simone. She has more allergies than I have sex.   And I have a GIANT CHEM TEST tomorrow, which is also our make-up test thingie.   My clarinet is still broken, even though store-Chris said that he'd fixed it.  Fidencio, George, and I went to Sutter today. Except for tuning and discipline, they are as good as (better than?) we are, en masse. Tuning counts for a hell of a lot, but... sigh. They don't have any outstanding players, but they have a lot of competent players, and more players.   San Diego!!!

0	For those of you who don't know Jordan Hardin passed away last night, he was in a motorcycle accident...  Jordan (my pimp), I will miss you so much, I loved talking to you and we always had so much fun together. I will cherish my prom picture I got with you for the rest of my life. I am saddened that I only got to know you for such a short time. But in that time you brought me laughs, smiles, happiness, and so much more. I will miss our talks in History, and our lil chats in the hall from you telling me to get to class! May God take care you from this point on, I love you and will never forget you and I will see you again one sweet day.  Please everyone be careful and remember that little fights that are stupid and pointless are not necessary. You never know when that person will leave this Earth.
0	I dont like the fact that I have people on my friends list, but I am not on theirs. I think its unfair that people can read into my journal and my personal thoughts but i cant read theirs. So...I am filtering my friends list.       evilegan    is the first casualty since i have asked her all week to be put back on her list and she hasnt done so. So egan if u want back in, you know what to do.    For the rest of you--if u wantt o remain on my friends list, let me know. Until then---later

1	I finally gave in and got a live journal.  I probably wont actually use this to write in, that's what  my blog  is for!  But I really want to be able to comment on some of my friends journals without having to worry about forgetting to write my name on those "anonymous" entries.  So yeah.  *waves*   Frozen  - my blog / journal type of thing  pange@devART  - my art and writing  Luminaire  - the m.nu forum (post as Pange)  FFAlliance  - gaming forum (post as Pange here too)  Magitek.nu  - everything else

1	a friend sent me a money order for $950. i get to keep $200. ya know...for my troubles. i found a way to make some extra scratch.  :D
1	There's a ton of new snow in the Sierra Nevada (about 4 ft of fresh powder). I'm really tempted to go there for the week-end, to go ski and to go snap some pics. I'm thinking about sleeping in Reno, skiing in Mt Rose on Saturday and hiking/taking pictures in Squaw Valley on Sunday.
0	All right i talked to erica and i am much calmer about things. and hopefully things will get worked out. i'm glad i talked to her before i made to many mistakes. either way i know nothing is going to be the same. =/ and that makes me sad.
0	Its sunday... i'm still alive...!!!  Didn't go to the footie game today (we won 50-0! Can you believe it?!?) because i wanted to do work. Sort of spent most of the day in bed but i'm the LRC now aren't i? At college lane but i'm going to see if i can get over to de havilland because they have a book i need to write my essay and for some reason they wont hold it for me - rude!  Better run, have a (different) essay plan for tomorrow plus more group work stuff... oh and i'm meeting up with a few people to see if we can crack this linguistics assignment together........  Laterz, love n fluff, Sunny x x x  Ben was coming to my house for Christmas day, i was so excited the other day that i couldnt sleep but alas that was too good to be true and now he's not coming :,( POO!
0	Hey everyone, well...nothing new!!!! I just thought I'd update LOL.  Spring break is almost over :( yeah! I'm going back to campus on Sunday.  I still haven't done that paper I was supposed to be working on =/   I don't know if I'll ever stop procrastinating *sigh* so I gotta do it tomorrow or else!!!! I started working on another drawing last night!!! this one is big!! on an 18x24 pad.  It's coming along ok I guess!!!  Later,
1	extremely cool.  Right now I'm sitting here in my living room watching the Giants game.  How awesome is that?  Now I can browse the net from any room in the house.   The laptop itself is also extremely nice and portable.  Here are the  specs .  One of my fantasy teams had a really good day today - my guys hit like 4 home runs.    Europe is a little less than a month away.    Rock on. Will
1	One week left until summer. Tooooootally awesome.    Five exams between me and summer...bring it on.
1	Happy easter everyone..i love this whole week off thing....today i went to mass and wore my prom stuff because i figured if im going to pay so much money for a suit i might as well where it again, i have a picture of it on mypace so check that out...anyway today were having family over for dinner....LAst night i went over my cousins for alittle, but then i picked up lauren, we went to ritas and we couldnt get a free water ice because andrew wasnt working, but we still got some....then we went to mandys work place and saw her but she couldnt give us free food...boo...but then we went to tookany( spell check) and took a fun walk....then we went home and dyed some eggs! well im done talking...HAPPY EASTER!
0	The reason I haven't updated is that I am completely depressed.  Everyone has a girlfriend but me and it's pissing me off. It's not like I haven't tried Goddammit, but no one seems interested in an egg. I'm not asking for much, just a squishy, friendly chick who doesn't mind some of the old egg nookie.  I've tried to get a girlfriend, I really have. I took up swing dancing to meet chicks but I had to quit because it really sucked. I really hate dancing. I was gonna take up some fancy schmancy cookery class but it's really hard to find one that doesn't use eggs in any of the recipes and I can't stand those freaking vegans.  I spent the whole of last night just sitting and staring out the window and getting more and more pissed off at the world. I'm so sick of suffering like this, but I can't see a way out.
0	Well...My whole weekend is shot.  Tomorrow I'm stuck at home.  I don't get to see Adam except for like 20 minutes in the morning...Then it won't be until Monday.  He works Friday and Saturday, I work Saturday and Sunday, so my Friday and his Sunday don't meet.  :-(  He wants me to stay with him Monday, but I doubt that's going to fly with my parents.  I am going to try--beg--plead even if I have to.  I miss him so much.  Plus, I was supposed to call him but there is no answer.  Go figure.
1	I  love   love    love   my Heller.  I'll type up my schedule, when I get a chance.  (And now I know how to use colors in html!  Yay!)
1	well today my lovely wife and I celebrate our 8th year married together. I don't know if that's good or bad (ducks cat being thrown at me) but I can tell all the men this, I still don't understand women, hehe. we went down town and walked thru the Boston Gardens and looked at a bunch of store down newbury street, but we avoided one of our favorites. Down newbury street there is a small hole in the wall store. the guy sells old stain glass from churches and he also sells gargoyles!!!! It's an awesome place, but a place, but you can spend more money faster than you have. I love the place.  Today though I do find myself in a better frame of mind, I am thinking more clearly about the whole situation with the inlaws. I guess that there is only one person who I have to keep happy on this earth and that is my wife (there daughter) so there will have to get over me being ME :)
0	Well Saturday the 10th... I enjoy alot... I went to Chris House and hang with him AND Jon... GGRR! I had fun, we went to the carvinal. We only went on only three rides. It was so lame!!! The carvinal was so small, I did enjoy it, but not fully. I was just glad that I go to spend time with Chris before he leave to Canada. I'm Sad... Well my mind is not working... 1 month!!
1	I won in my match today too! The score was 6-0, 6-2. I play for the title tomorrow at 4pm. So who's coming? :-p I'm so excited!!!
1	This is so totally newsworthy:   http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/picture s/2005/03/25/032507-950x315-badreporter.g if   Maybe Jesse Jackson will visit The Finger!  *bwahahaha*
0	Why is it that my eyes have suddenly become so filled up with tears? Is it the realization of the things I've yet to be? Like being a good lover? Or good at life in general? Maybe it's the fact that I am just meant to be messed with twenty four seven. Maybe it's the fact that my own parents cannot look at me and be proud of their own son, no matter without thinking of what people might say if they are seen with me in public.  Do you really still love me?You are killing me with your silence. It seems as if you do not want to see or talk to me. Please talk to me. I love you so much and I dont want to lose you. Can I honestly continue to be happy around everyone when all I feel are millions of daggers aimed at my heart ready to strike at any given minute? I hope that the calvalry will come and take the weapons away and shine the light on who my heroes are. Talk to me people, call me, I like to talk. You should know it. If not its 5686982.
0	I'm breaking out into a sweat.  I have an art exam tomorrow, and have done NOTHING.  *word echoes eerily as rowana sobs*  What am i going to do!!??  arson is a possibility.  I'd have lots of friends if i burnt the school down. Maybe i can bribe the teachers?  No...no good.  They're too...too...supportive.  nice.  Sickening, i know.  I blame the government  I think i'm gonna have to go through with it.  Jess, you can have all my books.  The rest of you can squabble amongst my meager possesions, whilst my spirit drifts away, detached from my body by Mrs Morgan's critical glare.  *sobs*  Tell Mum...i'm sorry.  I'm getting sickeningly cliched now.  yugh.  okies then, moving onwards, I need ellie's user name so that i can add her!!    ELLIE!!  WHAT IS YOUR USER NAME!!??  Heh, I can't think of anything else to say...I am at a loss for words.  Incredible.
0	It's the end of an era.    Other Bitch is leaving in the morning.  Rumor has it she will be in her new apartment by noon.  I wonder what life will be like without her.  I honestly can't imagine my days before she was in them, but that's not saying much.  I can't remember my own birthday, either.  Ted Berrigan's  The Sonnets  has been around the apartment this week.  I'm generally not one for poetry, but I must admit I'm riveted.  He's a fascinating weaver of story, that Ted Berrigan.    Dear Other Bitch, it is 6:43 pm in Portland.  I rage in orange-brown-black-white fur, on a beige windowsill, in a dusky room, sustained by the darkness outside and a cast-off emotion.
1	Today is my happy b-day!!!! And so far so good!! i have met up with my grand father and grand mother on my fathers side and it was fun. Have showed what i have done so far!! =) always fun to show off =) even thou thay dont understand what i actually have done =)   anyway off for now.  Greetings Gramse! =)
1	Like so many of you have already noticed...the weather has been kicking some major ass.  My day was spent, in it's entirety, out and about.  Flops were a floppin' and the wind was a blowin' betwixt my thighs....always a good time.  I spent a grand total of 5 minutes in my dormroom from the time I left for class at 9:30 to when Taryn dropped me off before That 70's Show at 8:00.  I feel free.  I discovered a new awesome band today.  Stellastarr.  Cute, huh?  It called to me, and I fell in love at first listen.  $14 later...it nestled its way into iTunes. LOVE.  I cannot wait for summer to arrive.  I vow to appreciate it as I've never appreciated it before.  I vow to stay outdoors as much as possible.
1	The show was great.  I got to see my homies from WUT, at least some of 'em, and got some nice hugs from the girls.  I got to give Mary the magic cd, which I've been meaning to do for a while.  For one reason or another, I've got that old feeling that anything is possible, and good things are coming, world without end.  I love my cast.  Right now I feel like we will move to a great theatre, and we will put on shows that wow the crowds and move the people, and we'll have a good time doing it.  More than anything life is full of possibilities right now.
1	yesterday my mom found a tiger my lil bro set on fire and she was pissed. Today Jenn ran up to me and gave me a hug and it was cool even though I know most people are not approving with us being friends again but no one owns me!!!! So I can do what ever the fuck i want to with my life!! This is probally what I need anyways so that amber will understand even though she seems pissed off by the fact that i am talking to her owell!!! I am sittin in the computer lab with Mike whom is looking at cars which reminds me of another mike who has new best friends and like to get burnt by the muffler of a bike!!! well I am bored 161 more days until HalLoweEn!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	I don't know what to say. I know what I'm thinking but I'm scared... maybe I'll think about it some more and post again later. I've been thinking a lot. It's really getting on my nerves. A lot of things are really getting on my nerves. I'm really upset, so I'm gonna think about this some more and post later.
1	I don't care what anyone thinks, I feel this warrants a post.  I OWN LEGO PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My friend from Germany sent them.  I own a little lego_draco, a little lego_harry, a little lego_lucius and a little lego_dobby. (little lego_dobby is being very much ignored, tee hee) I spend much time petting my little lego_people and having little conversations with them. Little lego_lucius doesn't like me and won't talk though....I don't know why, I got the impression he was leading me on! My maiden's heart feels trifled with! ^_~  Oh, and my friend in London lives near a toyshop. The most popular toy that sells there is the little lego_lucius.        lego_draco   , your father is found attractive and NOT old by many. Deal with it. ^_^
1	   Happy Birthday to ME! Happy Birthday TO me! Happy BIRTHDAY to me-eeeee, HAPPY Birthday to me!     You may now resume your regulary scheduled St. Paddy's Day activities.  Oh, and Constantine Maroulis still rules!
1	I won both my auctions on Ebay!! W00T!! The full run of Legion of SuperHeroes and Legionaires are all mine! MINE!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Incidentally, I paid out my ass for them because I expected to get outbid.
1	I am feeling so grateful for the return of sunshine.  I did have to close my windows last night though.    Does anyone remember the old Gumby dolls?  I have felt like one of them this week with all of it's limbs being pulled and stretch in all directions.  I think the sunshine is all that has saved me from insanity.  My week will be calm for the remainder.  Yay!  I shall settle into an early weekend starting tomorrow evening.    And, in spite of it all, I am feeling very happy right now.  I still have a swirl of thoughts and feelings flooding my mind, but I hope to wash them out long enough to get a good nights sleep.
1	I saw Harry Potter yesterday and it was amazing! I think this one was better than the last 2.  It seemed a little more darker and edgier, the special effects were pretty cool. I don't know if I want to give too much away her, I don't want to ruin it for the people who haven't seen it yet.  All I have to say is if you didn't see it yet, Do it. You won't be disappointed, I'll go see it again too! :)
1	I have the best boyfriend ever. I love how  psychic  he is.      I also love spaghetti and cheese toasted sandwiches. You know what  would be amazing? If they put spaghetti on those McDonalds bacon,  cheese and egg bagels. That would be fucking orgasmic. 
1	guess whos going to richmond today til tonite nite? ME!!!!!!!!!!! so if you wanna hang call 409 256-9500....or call michelle or nina hightowers cell phone!! everyone have an awesome day/nite...GO CRAZYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! AND KEEP ROCKING FOR JESUS!!!
0	It's a been a great break everyone, and the most depressing (for me) exit I've made ever.  I wish I spent more time with all of you, but I hope that none of you felt I neglected you.  I hope you all had happy holidays and I hope you all have a great new year.       elliedb06    and I are watching  Revenge of the Nerds  tomorrow, early afternoon, here, if any of you want to come. And with that, El Jay, I bid you goodnight.  I am off to pack and to sleep.
1	After a 3 year hiatus, blonde has returned to my head.  I like it.         
0	my favourite pot lying shattered on the floor cannot be replaced
0	Just dropped       downthedip    at the airport.  He is such a modest king.  Forgot that he doesn't need to stand in line at the check in counter.  Can't say that I wish I were going.  Haven't had much luck with grandmas.  The other one gave me flying lessons.  This one, who knows what she might do, especially with       sweet_pickles    sending a barrage of postcards and letters to       downthedip   .  I don't know why, but this seems to annoy her.  Still, I am sad.  What will I do without him for two weeks other than get all the pillows to myself?  *sniff  I think I need a hug too.
0	today made me sad... i found out andrew fancies a girl in my year - i know i dont know him and i accept that he is bound to have a girlfriend because he's so hot but the girl he has chosen has an orange face  it makes me sad  other things make me sad - Emily mainly  Drama makes me happy tho... we actually got some work done today which made a change        why would he fancy someone with an orange face?
0	you brain starts cheering  "You Suck" over and over and you dont notice for several minutes and even then it takes a while to register how unusual this should be.
0	I'm sure you've been wondering where I've been lately. I certainly hope the Main House doesn't mind. If they did, I'm sure they'd have come found me by now. I've been staying with Temari for the last few weeks. Well, and Jiraiya but... I won't say anything else on that.  Lee is still gone... Gai-sensei is at wits end. Even he doesn't know where he could have gone. And of course TenTen and I worry. I mean, we're a team... right?
1	Well, I'm not ANST: Forsaken.  And I'm really happy about it.  I truly loved ANST.  Mostly because of the convention games.  But long story short (as most of my friends can attest) I was really worried about not having the time I needed, and I really want to use what time I do have to tell good stories at home.  I applied because I love the venue.  I applied because I felt that if no one else who could fit the bill came forward, I could make the time.  I'm really relieved that this wasn't the case.  So, to new ANST: Forsaken -- I'm here for you if you need anything!  And to Phil Rickaby -- you made me feel great about my work.  It means a lot from me to hear good things from you -- and speaks a lot of the respect we all have for you.
1	I had a meeting this morning with my English teacher. Just to see how things are going and whatnot. I got an A- on my last paper, and I have an A for the class. Everyone else that I've talked to has had a hard time getting a B on papers and in the class. Good right? *nods* And my teacher, who went to school for years to get an English degree. My teacher who is very well read and has many students complaining that he grades way too hard and teachers telling students that they won't hold them to "Pascoe Standards", told me I was a good writer. LoL That just made my entire day. It's a nice thing to hear from anyone, especially someone you really look up to as a writer, but when you hear it from someone as well educated as that...and someone who has high expectations of you...it's just awesome. =D  As cheesy as it sounds, that was the highlight of my day. hehehe
1	We finally got a DVD plaer for Christmas (late, of course!). It is really cool. WE watched Monsters Inc. and Harry Potter last night. We're watching the 10th Kingdom right now. It's really cool. I'm glad we finally got our DVD player! Gotta go. Bye bye.
0	Well, I got laid off on monday.  Also, someone very close to me is going in for a biopsy next week.   I was going to tell the layoff story, but quite frankly, it sucks ass and I'm tired of telling it, so let me just say that I'm not  unhappy to be out of there, but the manner of my departure I'm not so happy about.  I've got a couple of months worth of cash, mostly thanks to the California state law that requires they pay me back vacation (did I ever take any...?).   What's more irritating is that now I have to return this perfectly fine laptop and wireless rig.  Ah well.  I'll run a little ethernet  around the house finally.
0	         You Are a "Don't Tread On Me" Libertarian             You distrust the government, are fiercely independent, and don't belong in either party.  Religion and politics should never mix, in your opinion... and you feel opressed by both.  You don't want the government to cramp your self made style. Or anyone else's for that matter.  You're proud to say that you're pro-choice on absolutely everything!          What political persuasion are you?   
0	I hate my life.  I'm serious.  And I wish I had the courage to die.  Because right now, that's what I want more than anything else in the world.  To just have some FUCKING peace.  (I'm sure the moment will pass... but not for a long, long time)  This is why I used to cut.  And I really really want to do it right now... but something about it seems so juvinile.  I hate everything.  And everyone.
0	 And I don't want the world to see me cause I don't think they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am.   Justin said I'm dedicated for writing songs. I say I'm emo.  Too friggen emo lately. Even  I find myself wanting to kill the emo kid.  Here comes that depressive state that I get in every 2 weeks. But only now I have reasons to feel down.  Has anyone noticed that a lot of my entries aren't public anymore?  Does she have something to hide?  Yes, she does. Too many things.. I can't take living like this, but I'm going to anyway. You can't hide the tears that aren't coming.  Being depressed sucks.   *sigh* I'll presume unanncounced. Carry on.
1	my room is revamped!!! old desk was dismantled by the destroyer, sherwin and was thrown away by mr muscleman, sherwin. new desk was fixed up by mr handyman, sherwin also. heehee.... really good to have him ard. he's everything rolled into one.   anyway back to my room. finally i cleared my things! i cleaned up my room, threw away ALOT of things and tidied things up (still not very tidy though). arranged my bed and tables and drawere also so now my room has a new look and i love it! more spacious, more space to walk abt and room looks brighter! so exciting!   may this new look of my room bring good luck to me! (hopefully feng shui is better also!) hahahaha!  lastly, a very happy chinese new year!!! woohoo! ang baos time! here i come!
1	last night julie, chris, annette, colin and i hung out at julie's house and it was just crazy. we watched dirty dancing 2 and we all drank so as the night went on things just started getting more and more funny lol. we took a bunch of random pictures and just hung out for the whole night but it was really nice. i hadn't seen annette in like a friggin year and i love her because she's just as obsessed with nip/tuck as i am and that makes me very happy. but yeah it was good to see everyone and its really sad because everyone's starting to leave for school and i don't want them to. oh well, fun times were had and someday when we're all home we WILL go clubbing and it'll be fun. ok that's all i have to say for now. i'm off to the mall to spend money that i don't have lol. ~mal
1	I feel like a messenger going from here to there^^  Apparantly Sonchou just took the files off thier bittorent site but they're actually going to continue subbing it (YAAAAAY!!!) and distribute it through mIRC at:  server: irc.rizon.net room: #sonchou-fansubs  And Serge, I was wrong, Naruto wasn't licensed
0	I'd say I miss you, but that wouldn't be accurate, because at this point I don't think I ever really knew you.  I will say that I miss the person I thought you were, which is sad, because that person obviously doesn't exist and probably never did.  I guess I have to leave it at that.
1	not much has been happening, i hung out with my A-town friends monday night, during which we played risk and watched the patriots lose.  it was good and a nice reminder of the fun times we had in high school.  somehow i managed to get a C im both stats and economics, so that was good as well.  i've got to run now, i have a discgolf game coming up.  i'll be back to talk soon

1	Well... when I rose from bed this morning, litterally... it was like something out of a fuckin' movie and after I showered I glanced in the mirror as I was buttoning up my shirt, smirked and said it was going to be a good day.  And by the Gods is it.  I saw the cell sweeping across the Southern portion of Ohio and I just laughed.  For once I have better weather than Miami.  Sunny, warm compared to what it has been... and the best part?  I've got the rest of the day off.  As soon as I got to work, the program we use was running slow as hell and eventually it just flat-out crashed.  And, we did everything that didn't require a computer... so we all got sent home.  The only thing that may suck is making up the time, but fuck it.  So right now I'm gonna go get some food then I don't know.  May drive around, might get my Concepts homework done... don't really know, don't really care.  Shit, I might even skip class and go over to Jobe's for the Beer Olympics.  Bring home the gold, baby!
1	A blast from the past, DJ who graduated, oh 2 years or so ago, came by for a surprise visit to my office.  I like getting random surprise visits from people that I haven't seen in years.  It makes my day just that much better.   Beer Summit  is coming up next weekend.  I completely forgot about it.  Last year I worked the summit and had such a great time.  I really wish my financial situation was a bit better than what it is right now.  Blah.  I'm so looking forward to drinking just past the noon hour to.  Sun's out.  Life looks good.  Must get my arrows cut, points installed, and get them tuned up for outdoor season.
1	I would love to respond to several posts that have been written, but i just have a few moments while my sister gets her hair cut.  i just finished getting my hair cut. i told heather, the stylist, to do what she wanted. So she did. i love it. :-) it is a lot shorter, but it is a fun length. i am honestly amazed at how much hair she took off. This entry is really really boring. Oh well, i think i am gonna have to start making plans to come down here when i need my hair cut again. should anyone be in the raleigh area and need a haircut, the design gallery salon is awesome! in other news, i am in NC. i have no sense of direction. i am having sushi for dinner. i am having a blast!!!
1	Becca has this cat named Baxter and boy howdy is it awesome.  He's huge and hilarious.  I would never try to eat that particular cat.  Hahaha
1	This weekend turned out to be greater than expected.  While I was planning it to be pretty uneventful and lonely, I ended up getting out of the house and having fun.  On Saturday night, I met up with Andy to get some delicious Cold Stone ice cream.  I hope I didn't blab his ears off though especially since I haven't had many people to talk to recently so I had some catching up to do :)  Then we got to hang out again on Sunday to see the movie "Cellular."  It was definitely a great movie with the exception of the horribly irritating people sitting behind us...lucky us! Fortunately, tomorrow is Columbus Day so my mom will be home for the day.  It's much better than being alone in the house and attempting to keep myself occupied.  I guess I'll see what the week has to come :)

1	Ok so I might be a little hyper today.  I talked to Gary for a bit.  It was so good hearing his voice.  The only bad part is it makes me want to feel his arms around more.  I am honestly thinking about surprising him at work tommorrow.  Just to see him for a few moments.
1	Given that I have only read through # 21 and have yet to get # 22 & 23 I shouldn't have been looking, but since I did...   Preview Art for  Negation  # 24  at  Comics Continuum .

At least, it looks that way from the first four pages.  It is also nice to see Pelletier and Meikis draw Charon's Ligis bearers. I wasn't wild about the art in  Mark of Charon .

The current holder of that honor, as you all probably already know, is The Thrill Dragster in Cedar Point.  The new coaster is called   Kingda Ka  .  It's manufactured by the same company that created Thrill Dragster, Intamin AG of Switzerland.  Click on the picture below to go to the Six Flags press release.

0	I'm so sick of this.  So sick of being picked on, and constantly told that I'm a disappointment, and not good enough.  No, I'll never be good enough to meet their expectations.  I'm sick of being sick, and I'm tired of being tired and getting these headaches all the time, and then, on top of that,  just feeling completely worthless.  My mother has the nerve to tell me that I'm tough to love and then yells at me for having a sucky attitude when I try to defend myself.  And then, tonight, she comes down to pick on me some more, and not only that, my dad's joining in too.  Whatever.  I'm just not going to bother trying to impress them, anymore, because it's clearly not working.   So much for feeling like I matter.
1	so i cant make up my mind to love or hate...but i think its love....at least like, today....walmart run, and buying a game that makes me happy....hunting, fishing, and camping trivia game!!!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) its a redneck thing.....not everyone would understand... so i spent immense amounts of time in walmart last night, and then after that me n jaimee went back to my house and baked goodies till 130 am....lol...then we were sneaky and delivered goodie plates at 215 am....lol....so when the boys came downstairs in the morning, they thought santy claus was there!! actually, it was the goodie fairies! :):) i am so sneaky sometimes.....lol.... anyways, back to interning, im out..

Like unexpectedly smacking your head on the underside of your desk, it's not so much the pain as the fact that you weren't expecting it.    When I grow up, I want to be the Tinman.

0	I've been away for quite some time now  though I'm sure no one noticed I was away... , due to a sudden computer crash. But all is well. I probably shouldn't be up this late, but I haven't surfed the net in so long.  Plus I can't sleep...    My foster parents have been arguing a lot lately. I'm not sure what's going on, but I have a gut feeling it's about me  apparently, it's always my fault . Perhaps they've come to the conclusion that they weren't ready to be parents, and decided to send me back to the orphanage where I'll be passed around once again to another couple who seeks to adopt.   Just thinking about it makes me want to cry...     Sigh...  Sorry for the depressing entry. I'm sure you guys don't want to read about my problems.  I should go to bed now.
1	Livejournal is so awesome, I don't want to go to school tomorrow and miss out on all the stuff!!! :)  Let me try a different picture for this one!  I joined so many cool communities!! I can't believe there are so many people with the same interests as me! THAT ROXXX!!!!
1	I won something.  :o)    I won an over night stay for 2 to Salish lodge in Snoqualmie.  I get an overnight stay, 2-50 minute spa treatments, and breakfast for two! PSE did a drawing for people who donated to Artsfund.  Last year I won a poster.  This year I won grand prize!  In 2003, I won an overnight stay at Semiahmoo because I donated money to United Way.   Every time PSE does a company sponsored fund raiser they always have great prizes that they give away to help motivate people.  I always say I never win anything but I'm guessing I should probably stop saying that now!  I was feeling cranky this morning but now it's went away.  :o)

1	So much going on, it's hard to believe some times all the crap that I do.  Work is actually going really well, which is nice.  It's a bit of a mess, and high stress, but I think it is for the better, and things will improve, fo sho.  Not being as social as I would like, I need to change that, get out more.  Trying to be healthier...that trip to Vegas was interesting, too many perfect people at one time in one place...  The other job is going really well too...Going to launch a new version of it soon, which will make it easier to increase customer loyalty.  Oh!  That reminds me...if you know anyone famous who wants to get free stuff, let me know...currently working on a promotion, and we need some name recognition.  Not in terms of advertising, but...well, just let me know.  It's a cool, and creepy, idea, but I think it will work.  OK, that's all for now.  I need to start posting more.  I need to stop saying that less.

He didn't win a single competition, he alwasy lost to Austin or Kara Saun and then he won the whole thing!!  *does a dance*  I forced Phil to watch it with me.  Poor boy, he is sooo not into fashion.  He did admire a coat that Jay made though.  Lol.  Sadly the Bravo website seems to be down so I can't get a picture of the coat to show you.  Oh well, not like you care anyways!  HOORAY FOR JAY! I luff that silly man.  Hrm, this may have been a spoiler if you had wanted to watch it.  Oh well.  It's all over the internet by now anyways. :)

0	When my sister told me that her husband's family finally find a house to buy in Staten Island, I was so happy and thought to myself,"Finally, she can move out all her stuff from my apartment and I can start redecorating." The house was on processing and waiting for closing, then the seller's laywer told her that they are not selling the house and closed the deal. Damn man, they spend over $1,000 on laywer fee and inspection fee for nothing. That house is very nice and my sister was really looking forward to move in around March. Now her heart is shattered. Those bastard, I bet they closed the deal so they can sell it to a higher bidder.

1	I FOUND FINROD!!!  I went poking about town today, doing nothing in particular, and decided to go see a movie.  When I arrived at the theater, I found the show didn't start for 90 minutes, so to kill some time I swung by a local pet shop to look at the fish.  And there they were - three nice, healthy little pearl gouramies.  After the movie I stopped back and picked one up, and now Finrod is swimming around investigating his new realm.  I still haven't managed to locate any harlequin rasboras, but I'm sure I'll find some eventually.  Tomorrow I'll clean the algae off the front of the tank and shoot some pics of Nargothrond.  Here's hoping they turn out well!  (I've got to do some work on the Galvorns as well - bet you all thought I'd forgotten about those.  You were almost right.)

1	   This weekend was awesome. We went to a club and some bars and bunch of parties. Hung out, met new people, saw some olds one and over all rocked the house. So it was fun. That picture is from the night we went to Stetsons'. It was a sort of Country club that played Rap. Strange but lots of fun.   Well I suppose I should go finish my homework! :(    More later, Smange
1	 As sad as I am at the Pope's passing, I can't wait til all the  CONCLAVE  stuff starts... if you've read Dan Brown's (the dude who wrote the Da Vinci Code)  Angels and Demons  you'll know what I mean. I'm talking&nbsp;murdered branded bishops, Illuminati, pyramids and other masonic symbols&nbsp;in Rome, secret passages and conspiracy, ooh can't be waiting!     PS. Angels and Demons is much better than The Da Vinci Code. But don't read either of&nbsp;them if you've got important essays or courseworks to do, they'll never get done. Which I'd known that before dammit! 
1	I really love the words to that song!  Tonight is great! I'm sitting here chatting to lovely people and for the first time in a long time I can actually know I have nothing to wake up early for. Ashton is at Brendan's house for the night. I do miss him heaps though and I feel strange knowing he's not sleeping in his room here right now. I just needed a break and I needed to relieve some of my stress. Heaps of my stress went away tonight after finding out some news which has took a lot of it away. I'm in a great mood and I'm so happy! All I want now is for things to just get better... I wanna start building MY house and have my OWN family in my OWN house with my OWN furniture and pictures on the wall and things.. just Brendan, Ashton and Me! In 6 weeks hopefully all this will be starting and my life will start piecing itself together. I love you Brendan and Ashton, and I love all of you my friends heaps!

0	I just called the chiropractic office that I had the interview with, and a woman answered the phone.  She's a new hire.  Therefore, I obviously didn't get the job.  Stiff upper lip, Calli.  There's another interview coming up on Friday.
1	Hi there, I'm Ash, and I'm 16. I was actually born in the US, and still live there, and I've never been to Wales. However, my family is Welsh, and within the past few years I've started to take an interest in it and pride in it, and I just thought that I would join so that I could learn more about Wales.   I hope that you all will still let me join
1	Okay, the party can start now... I am now active on LiveJournal. I have been meaning to start one for a while and with the persuasion of friends and Aaron here I am. Hopefully I will get a good look going to my site but for now I am just going to go with this. Well, feel free to post responses as I go!!!

0	Today sucked, plain and simple.  Had court this morning and I think I answered every question wrong possible: 20 hours community service, $100 courst costs, $350 attorney costs, and 6 months probation. Awesome.  In addition, I bombed two quizes, in the same class no less (one was a make-up quiz) and the teacher thinks I'm retarded for asking basic circuit questions during his office hours.  Also, I forgot my laptop in Dearborn, so that was a nice little hour trip back there to pick it up.  But, from all this, I can only hope to fufill some of my New Year's resolutions. I figure, if I'm already at my lowest point in my life right now, I mind as well build it back up right. Now, if only I could get some support with all these things...  Yea, like that's going to happen.
0	That's all. It sucks. Everything sucks. Major suckage.
0	I need to talk to someone.        I'm more worried than I have ever been in my entire life.  I'm scared.  I'm worried about what I have done and I don't blame you if you never want to speak to me again.
1	chris got the keys to the new house yesterday, so last night after work we went over. they had just cleaned the carpets and did some painting and cleaning, i suspect we really weren't supposed to be in there until our actual move-in date (feb. 1st) but it was cool to see it, and we did some measuring to get an idea of where we can fit our furniture.   afterwards we drove around the neighborhood and went to the local grocery store, Molly Stone's, where i bought some kaboom energy drink (yum!). dude, Molly Stone's is so.freaking.cool. along with having an awesome selection of natural foods and organic stuff, they have a crazy animatronic theatre in the middle of the store for little kids (chris and i were too chicken to press the button to start it, tho.) according to the  website , they also have kiddie rides, but we didn't see those. what a neat store!  i've always wanted to move to palo alto. so glad to finally do it!
0	... I just cut my arm again... it's so deep... it wont stop bleeding...   what the fuck is wrong with me!? how the hell did I go so deep!?  
1	 Me, playing with my hair in front of the mirror:  I didn't have any conditioner this morning.  Dave:  I guess that means I'll have to love you unconditionally...not conditionally, like I usually do.  I don't know when I'll be posting again.  So...  So long & thanks for all the fish. ;)
1	FIVE DAYS TILL I BECOME A COMPLETE ALCOHOLIC!!!!!! if any body finds me face down in a gutter will you please take me home(to my house preferably) but does anyone wanna hang out after my birfedday. yeah mabey i can finally make some more friends, that would be cool. if i talk to you on a regular basis and are cool with me and i have no beef with you please disregard the next portion of this post.     this next bit goes out to some fucktards that should be floating face down in a river    but anyhoozle on a more somber note i may just have to take a bat to the side of SOMEBODY's head. i'm not mentioning any names, but the people most likely to be on the recieving end know who they are. and just in case you're wondering, no this can't be used as a concrete threat because it is not directed at anyone. so there!:P just go ahead and leave a fucking comment, i want you to, just to give me a reason to get more pissed off. DO IT MOTHERFUCKER I FUCKING DARE YOU!!

1	Good morning. Today is going to be a pretty good day, I think. Michael and I are going to Los Arcos to eat dinner before the football game tonight, and then Brandon is going to be at the game! I'm so excited about seeing him again... yayness. It seems like forever since I've seen him... and he said he "comes bearing gifts"... presents??? For me??? Hmmmm...  Anyway, I finally got my rough draft of my personal narrative turned in. I'm still behind in the class, and I have a narrative to write about a "Significant Experience" to write about, a few assignments to do, and my Narrative Portfolio due on Monday. Hmmm... goodness. I guess I'll be up late tonight.   Well, I'm gonna get out of here. The bell is about to ring. Ciao for now.
1	Gakked from everyone.  1. When did you first "friend" me? 2. Why did you first "friend" me? 3. What posts of mine do you like to read the best? 4. What would you like me to write about that I don't? 5. Do you think we would be friends in real life? 6. How often do you read my journal? 7. What do we have in common? 8. Will you post this in your journal so I can answer? 9. Do I actually resemble any HP or SW character in your eyes?  Lauraflute:  to answer your history question about a couple specific instances I have found interesting and/or significant:  the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Battle of Midway (WWII, Pacific theater) come to mind.  More on those later.
1	So my birthday was actually.....  good Mom and I went to the DMV to get my permit!!  Finally!!  and it was a horrific experience because those people at the DMV play games with your mind.  I passed for your information!!  and then mom and i went to coldstones for a celebration.  Then we went to old navy, and didnt find what i wanted, so we went to roosevelt field to order my cookie cake!  that was sooo good.  We went out to dinner and then came home for cake.  It was actually a really good birthday!!  I got a call from California, Pennsylvania, and thanks to everyone else who wished me a happy birthday!!!
1	So all of you out there who have a show on XM...(you know who you are) What are the details again.
1	Sick...I'm so pathetic. I WANTED this morning to come so badly, and now I'm sitting up pretty early typing on here, waiting to go to Daina's for the ride. Ugh. This is rediculous, really, it is and I can't beleive myself.  I know I'll look back on myself in about a year and laugh my head off at how stupid I'm sounding at the moment, but that's usually fun, so I guess I'm only doing this for myself. In a year. Er...  *isn't making much sense* I hope the t-shirts turned out...
0	today seems to be going downhill very, very fast. i am feeling many things right now. i just need to get away somehow, stop everything. i just wish everything would end; i wish it could all go away. i wish i wasnt here.  fuck, i'm such an asshole...

0	Our car crapped out earlier today, in what's been the worst weather of the winter season.  By the good graces of       corsetress    the car is at a garage, and we (the wife, daughter and I) are all home and safe.  Based on what I was seeing and hearing, I'm fearing the worst.  The engine is making an unhealthy clunking noise and has a bad vibration, so I'm worried about somthing internal being broken.  I won't know anything more until sometime Monday.
1	 USA vs. Guatemala   Tonight, March 30th  Steps:  1) Buy your own tickets. (mine were 25 bucks and are basically on the 20 yard line.  You can get them at the gate, but they will be 2 bucks more.  Cheapest right now are 18 bucks)  2)  Meet at the Golden Rule in Hoover at 5 (right between I-65 and the Galleria.  Come on, Dixie, you want to come just for that.  Hell, if you just want to show up for the food but not the game, why not!!)  3)  Head to Legion Field and cheer on the Red, White, and Blue.  (Bring your artificial Noise Makers, 'cause I am.)   I'm excited!!
0	I have that feeling again.  I think it is the day after drinking alcohol depression (DAD).  I don’t have a hangover but I feel like crap.  I really don’t want to drink anymore this semester.  I was thinking about doing that no drinking thing again/not going out thing, but it is the end of the semester.   Really, I need to find friends that don’t like to go out………..I hate my DAD, I guess that could have two meanings, both would be true.  Maybe not, the correct phrase would be “I have no feelings for my DAD.”
1	I've been listening to Less Than Jake WAY too much...and it doesn't bother me. ^_^
0	ok today i have a feeling is going to be odd.  first i have to go and look at the car that i hit last night to see the damage and to see what parts that i need to order to fix it.  so that is going to talk a few hours and after that im not sure what will happen.  tomorrow would be anne and i's true 8th month things but we are broken up for the time being so its not any more.  i have to go and look at the damage   late
1	Well, the [edit: OUR] Superbowl party was a huge success.  Ingredients: 1. Dougies. In fact, a Dougies superbowl platter for 20 people. Including two three foot heroes, 150 buffalo wings, and tons and tons of spicy fries (and the works). 2. People - 13 people. Including       susievader    (and       kooshballrivky   ,       aimserraiecla   ,       tdc311   , and       queenkakia   ). 3. Me in a good mood. 4. Me headbanging, jumping off walls and tables, rocking out to The Who's We Won't Get Fooled Again afterwards.  The result: An awesome, awesome time.
0	i'm coming precariously close to screwing things up for good.   why am i about to ruin the best thing that could ever happen to me??  i'm becoming messy and i'm going to drag everyone down with me.....  (and even though i want to be, i'll never, ever, ever be one of them)  why can't i just be happy with the way things are???
1	Thank you so much to        nymphie   , for making me such  beautiful cards  to sell for Parker. I really appreciate it!
1	I am just waiting for them to call me and tell me when to start working.  I had to go take a pee test and the place I had to go to take it has to send them the results back and then Wal-Mart will call me and let me know when to be there.  Yeay!  No more heavy lifting for me.  I want to work there.  It will be all nice and quiet and whatnot.  Ok that is all I wanted to write.  Peace and love,  Mommy Bebo Maggot.
1	If you're up really late tonight (Monday night), check out ABC (Channel 6 in Philadelphia) from 3:00am-3:30am.  They are scheduled to play "Desperately Still" by The Last Dance during their weather segment tonight, over shots of the Canadian Rockies.
1	sometimes i don't understand people. i guess last week in my lit class religion came up. so today this lady brought in pamphlets for the teacher and my friend scott. then today capital punishment came up and she's like "KILL 'EM ALL!" and i don't understand. if you are such a devout christian, shouldn't you be merciful and forgiving? that's what god wants. i mean whatever. i believe in god but i'm just not super expressive about it. and i've never taken the time to figure this death penalty crap out, so i don't know where i stand but it just seems overly hypocritical to be like this lady. oh well. my teacher dropped five f-bombs. life is good.

Then the following day my parents came home...that was yesterday i think lol, and then i went to meg's and stood over and we went to the americana mall 2day, it was fun. Um and now it's pouring out so i don't know if anything is goin on 2nite. But that's about it. xoxoxo.

1	my internet was down all this time stupid piece of crap and now it's working obviously.nothing more to say really so bye!!! oh.. by the way the pictures of Michael in your journal is really cute, alien.
0	Life pretty much sucks at the moment... I didn't get into university, so I have to take extra credit classes to better my chances of getting in next year, but I can't afford that *grumble*. So yeah, life sucks. Oh well, at least I'll have a lot of free time on my hands to catch up on Gaia, Vzones and Neo... *sigh*. I spent a few hours in NH today, but I didn't see any familiar faces... Did everyone quit? And Gaia has changed so much, that'll take some getting used to.   Speaking of life sucking, I got into an argument with one of my best friends last week, and now I have this icky feeling that things won't be the same between us... I said some things I shouldn't have (no matter how true they are), and now there's no turning back...   *start philosophical mode* This really is a turning point in my life. I truly believe that the road I choose will affect the rest of my life in a big way. Let's just hope I make the right one... *end philosophical mode*        Wheee, new look *g*  
1	Wow!  I have a journal on the web now.  But I am not going to do this alone. I really am doing it together with my "mum". We have shared interests and experiences.  Let's see how this will turn out.
1	i pulled out the chipmunks christmas record today so i could listen to it.  i love it!  today i went on a cookie-making spree.  i made sugar cookies and chocolate chip cookies.  i decorated the sugar cookies with icing and sprinkles.  this is what i love about being on break.  a productive day involves cookies instead of 2,000 word essays.  last night i had a weird dream.  i was in a diner and some girl about my age came and sat with me and we were talking.  i don't really remember about what, but it was like she was trying to tell me to tell some people something.  it felt so real.  i wonder who she was.
1	i am seriously on a four month fucking high. things are really really awesome right now, and everything seems to be turning to gold for me. :)
1	Today ran 4.25 miles (according to Greg's GPS watch) in 35:33. Sadly Larry passed me up at the finish line and beat me by about 5 seconds, but I'm still happy with the result. That works out to about 8:22 miles, or average pace of 7.17 mph. I'm pretty happy with that for now. We're going to be running a 5K next week, so I'm excited to see how that goes. Here's hoping!
0	Napolean Dynamite comes out today!! And next Tuesday Garden State comes out!! I'm so excited. Elizabeth came to visit m e at work the other day. She had like a 4 hour visit. I'm always working now, but it seems it's always been that way. I'm most likely gonna become assistant manager cause our's might be leaving. But she's my favorite person to work with so I don't really want her to go but what can you do. I wish Christmas would be here already.
1	Setelah sekian lama tidak ada berita terbaru, akhirnya muncul berita heboh bahwa Julian telah bertunangan dengan Juliet Joslin, asisten manajer The Strokes. untuk lebih lanjut kunjungin www.livejournal.com/community/thestrokes congrats!
0	maybe because it's because i've never had thirteen young girls crying for me to stay that i don't understand why my sister can't depledge as she intended and get on with her life which is already better than theirs will ever be. i'm really proud of my sister for her inner strength, and just wish people would just grow some of their own instead of leeching off hers at the cost of her health and well-being. put your feet on the ground, and walk through your own personal hell.
1	We've had a lot of fun -- playing games, making lunch together, playing outside in the backyard with the dog, washing the car, reading a great story and more.  This is the way to start a new year. :o)  I feel like a good mom today. :oD

1	Y'know, I thought to myself while I was sitting around on MSN with Marie playing various crappy and useless games earlier, "I spam everyone, go to anonymous memes all the time and never, EVER make spam posts myself. Wtf is wrong with me?"  So yeah, to join that little gang of people setting up anonymous memes, I reckoned I'd start one. And since Valentine's day is nearby...   Livejournal brings together people of all genders, races and levels of sanity and we all grow to have our own little groups. So here, I want you to post ANONYMOUSLY the people that without them you wouldn't be here today. I want you to say who on your FL is your wonderwall and who you are the most thankful for of all. These are not just any old friends- these are our true friends here. It's nearly Valentine's day, so let's spread the love!

1	Okay so how cool is this... Monday night as we're leaveing the bowling ally these guys walked up to us and asked if we had jumper cables, we did. So we drove to go jump there car, we get there and they both have this stupid looks on their faces..they didn't know how to do it. So I took the cables and jumped the car. After I hooked them up to the battery, I reved the engine from the throttle on the engine of Megan's car. Of course I got the car started right up.These guys were so impressed with me it was hellarious! Their all like OMG your a girl, you know your shit, this is awsome. It was pretty cool. FuN! GiRlS RoCk!

0	I could do anything, I could stand on my toes and giggle like butterflies, I could dream entire worlds Write whole strategies for a war in fiction Drive two people together with a passion beyond the flames of hell And then.. I grew up. I grew up and I lost it all I was so happy in my world But I closed the door and threw away the key what I'd give for that little bit of silver weaved moonlight the one thing that my life had depended on and does again. and again. and again.. I am not proud.     Little black cat Standing in my path three steps back safety is to backtrack.  Break a mirror into shattered pieces A frozen horror A pinch of salt, over the shoulder.  I've done all these things Broken, sighted, saved But yesterday I shot the albatross.  Who can save me now?
1	Not much going on in life really.  But I thought I'd mention.  Dani got on this sudden kick of starting up the Emperor's New Groove story we started talking about 2 or 3 years ago and decided that now we need to work on it again.  If anyone's interested in seeing the twisted workings of our TENG minds go to       teng_story    and keep in mind the entries go backwards.  So the beginning of the story is the first entry. ^_^
1	A boy that once made me cry sought me out last night to apologize saying, "Jess, I feel really bad about the way I treated you.  You deserve so much better."  I said,"I know."  He continues," No, seriously.  You're smart and beautiful, I was stupid.  I'm sorry."  I think, "Wow, this really is my day.  A fantastic hair cut and a long overdue apology plus a pretty ran compliment."  Nice.  Thanks Brian.
0	Like I really needed this.  My grandmother was put into the hospital again. This time for pneumonia, which led to a congestive heart failure diagnosis. It’s not like it wasn’t expected; Gram’s been in and out of the hospital so very often lately.  I just… I can’t stand to lose more family. Not so soon after Grandpa’s suffering. (And, yet, I remind myself that it has been nearly seven months since Grandpa’s stroke. It seems both so far in the past and so close… I vividly remember each breath, and I remember when he didn’t breathe, and when he mistook me for Grandma, and when he asked me to read to him, and when my cousin and I sang to him…)   Like I said, Gram’s dire diagnosis isn’t entirely unexpected.   It’s just so hard to hear. So difficult to take. I don’t know if I can watch another person I love die slowly.   Or die quickly, for that matter.   I should quit talking for now… before I can only cry…
1	Everything has finally come together well most of it.. just waiting for next tuesday with tafe and then i will extra happy =)
0	 I sat there.  you told me:  'he said there wasn't much he felt by way of your touch, but if you could only imagine the madness he went though when it wasn't you he was touching.'  and this is supposed to make me feel better?     and with the joy that you've given me, I'm sure that you can find a way through, to the side of virtue.  
1	I am very new on LJ, but I joined this community. *Waves hello* I won't bother you by telling you why I am here, because you all know that allready.   I also have no friends :P
1	The snow has melted and the grass is green. It's warm enough to wear just my fleece and not shiver. In keeping with this spring spirit, I've decided to try to get back into shape and begin running with Colin. I'm really excited about this and I think it will be great for my health, and it's also a great step toward my goal of starting to dance again this summer :)
1	Well yesterday i dragged myself into one class - comp lit and they didn't even take a register - how annoyed was i!? anyway thats not the point of course - i was there to learn! I have now finished completely my dante essay (its all polly-pocketed) and ready to hand in. Yesterday we go 'love me if you dare' in the post which is a cool arty french film - i loved it as it was so random and weird. hehe. Watched location x3 last night and then onwards to csi but have to say it wasn't a very good episode - where was sarah!! Must have a look over my italian stuff for my test tomorrow but then afterwards we're doing lunch! yeee! Having lunch out today as well though - what a pie. ah well its the last week!

1	Micah and Casey had their baby!  Nehemiah Kenneth Groder January 6, 2005 1:48am 8lbs 1oz 20.5 inches  He was born really fast, so he didn't have a chance to get all of the stuff out of his lungs while he was being born, so now he's having trouble breathing. He's on assisted breathing, but should be able to come off later today. And I should be able to see him tonight! Thats all I know, except that the nurses call him Nemo, he has black hair that Micah made into a mohawk, and that Micah is rather pleased with himself (he's the one I talked to.) So keep them in your prayers.  Also, can I just say I'm glad its finally acting like New England winter and I'm pretty pleased with the large amount of snow we're receiving? Yes, yes I can.
0	I had managed to keep my mind off of memories of the fire for most of last week.  I visited Cokie at the hospital on Tuesday, did a lot of reading on Wednesday, and spent time at the mall with Jeff on Thursday.  I woke up early Friday morning because of a nightmare and I couldn't go back to sleep.  The fire was all I could think about.  It was like I was reliving it again.  That how intense the memories were.  I spent most that day holed up in my room.  I hate going through this every year.  I just hate it.
0	Oh no! Prefect Pansy Parkinson is missing? Not good, not good! Head Boy Adrian Pucey, Captain Draco Malfoy, and all the rest of the  Scary  Slytherins... If you need help looking for Prefect Pansy Parkinson, just let me know. I'd be more than happy to help  even if she does scare the pants off me .   Let's see... Um. Happy things. Happy things. Oh! Susie and I had fun shopping this weekend. I think I've just about got my shopping done! I just need to send away for one or two more things. Gosh, I hope I'll be able to get them in time for Christmas!
1	Others I'm fine :)  Just wanted to poke my head out of my cave and say hi to the natives. *waves* I'm still alive. I'm still doing the (to quote sparky) "Orthodox Mormon thing". And quite satisfied with it I might add. So anyway I know you guys miss me :D so I thought I'd make a brief appearance before disappearing once more into obscurity. seriously though. if you wanna get a hold of me my cell is 363-7258.  -lee
0	I am proud that I am not one of those people regularly heard bemoaning how The Simpsons has gone downhill for the past seven seasons (or nine or thirteen or whatever it suposedly is) but I must say, Sunday night found me actively disappointed.  The Simpsons go to China and we get heavy handed stereotypes, heavier handed political jibes, and hallucinary dragons.    I think the dragons would have been okey if I were high...
0	I ran into Jeff at a bar on Tuesday night.  He is such a creep, he tried to kiss me the whole night  BTW he is still with the Chalmidia slut that he cheated on me with.  L O S E R ! ! ! ! !  Damn and i wasted a year with that creep

0	"I will lend you my strength"  Does that mean leaving someone talking to thin air and wandering off when they really want to talk about important stuff?
1	I draw something '_' Because Hotaru/Yuuta always search her Fuji... I thought of drawing her one ;O; Hope you like it Hotaru~~~ *anlove*    "  How about a date ? XD "    Daisuki~ ^_^~  
1	Today I realized that I'm too up tight, don't tell me I'm not, cause I am. I worry about everything, and when I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING! Like friends, I'm just going to do my business and I'll pick up friends on the way. So here is my new motto: worrying is just like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do but it doesn't get you anywhere; write that down...
0	Not long after the mischief came back to us, I found a small tumor on Mouse just behind her front leg.  I was expecting this in many ways, since she's now past 2.  But it's been growing very fast, and last night I noticed she had lost quite some weight, and her ribs are very prominent.  So I'd have to say the tumor is malignant.  I don't know how much longer she'll hang in there.  I don't want to lose her.  She's such a little sweetheart.  She's still active, though she startles more easily than usual.    Time for lots of attention and extra treats.
1	i heard the message then i rang it off the hook i didn't get you till 1 am who was wrong and who was right and this distance caused a fight now i'm ready to give in  honestly i'd give anything to be with you right now  this town is full of dumb reminders having a good time can't you tell hang up the phone and then i come back down miss you i hope you're doing well  i'm used to waiting what's a voice without a face i think i'm dying without you here so i drink myself to sleep and then i hide beneath the sheet and i try to disappear  i get up every single time cuz you keep me alive  this town is full of dumb reminders how far ahead from you in miles if i could get one time as take it down maybe then i could see you  this town is full of dumb reminders having a good time can't you tell hang up the phone and then i come back down miss you i hope you're doing well        No use for a name is probably the best band ever... Boo ya grandma
0	I don't know what to do.  Her journal isn't positive.  I'd like to talk to her before she goes away for a week.  I want to give her space.....but with a message like that, i need to know.  Is it over?  I called, there was no answer.  Is she avoiding talking to me?  I'd rather just talk to her, so we can lay our cards on the table and face the deal.  I'm not mad at her.  If what I think is true, I'm sad.  But that's to be expected.  I hope I can talk to her before she leaves.  If what I think is true, it will be tough.  But I will still always be there for her.  Always.  Mj, have a good trip.  I hope I can talk to you before you leave.  Don't feel bad.
0	It Hurts 2 Hear or Find out that a Friendship from the past...Hates You Now for no reason now....
1	So I'm all set and ready to go, some of you can come out to these shows and say hi, it'd be a real surprise, seriously...  This is our first out of state show, for any of us and we've been in other bands...so exciting...     I received your letters and post card today, SO awesome, now I have something to look at for the trip, along with my real detroit and metro times...  Byebyeeeee
1	Today, attention span = zero.  Seriously, I got nothin'.  I'm in a ridiculously good mood, though.  The power of cold/flu/plague medication?  Perfect alignment of the planets?  Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying it completely.  Life is good.
1	I haven't laughed evilly, in like...FOREVER.  //firewalled against the Hyperion Morons and their broody leader.  Heh.    Heeheheheh   ...hhaaahaaa . bwaaahahaaa!  ...ahahha  Sorry, had to get that in there.  I ALWAYS wanted to do that.  Anyway.  I'm super-pissed that they haven't figured out its me yet.  I mean, are they really that dumb or do they just think stupid ole Harmony couldn't screw with their lives this bad?  I prefer to think that they're just. TOO. DUMB!!    So tonight I'm going to send them a clue.  More like a big fat anvil to the head.  It'll be all kinds of awesome!  //end firewall
0	I don't know what the hell happened tonight, it was sooo bad.  Everything is ok now but I have so many things running in my head I think I am going to explode!!  It really hurt me what she did, but I know what she is going through.  She said she was sorry, so its not that bad anymore. KT is one of my best friends ever since the 6th grade,and I don't want to lose her we have been through so many things I guess we just need to talk some more.   bye kalee
1	Got my new AlienWare PC last monday, and it's a real improvement over my last one, it alot faster can run most of the games that I wan't to play, and has more hadrive space then I really know what to do with, and yes it's been well worth the wait too.  I'm happy with it.  Later  MP
0	I'm sorta getting this feeling from friends i'm just not needed beyond what I can do to help them. Be it a ride or anything else.  That i'm starting to even outlive that usefullness. People don't make the first move hardly to start a conversation with me. I'm just in the way now it seems.  Being ignored and pushed away. Perhaps I am and perhaps that isn't the reality of it. I wish I knew how to deal with this.  -=Inorganic Feeling=- -=Fujii Griffon=-
0	You know your sad when you block someone for saying congratulations on finally turning an adult.....well if your that sad then i guess your just a child trapped inside an ugly adult body.....LMAO its so sad
0	I've been missing Jethro alot lately. Hiei is a wonderful kitty and I'm so glad we have her but she's a totally different cat, and not a rebound cat so I am still grieving the loss of my handsome boy.  I went out into the backyard to visit the rhodedendron we buried him under.  The leaves on it are turning bright red and there was a mouse sneaking around in the grass nearby.  It was oddly touching.

0	small update. i don't feel like writing all my feelings right now. i saw the icredibles (really good) and garden state last night. garden state was amazing, but it really hit a chord in me and made me cry. kalman was good at comforting me. i dunno, i think i'm still kinda messed up from it. but it's such a wonderful movie anyway.
0	Well it looks like Meas. 36 passed.  I feel for all the people that are having other peoples religious beliefs forced upon them.

0	Today wasn't to good, everything was good until I got home, I'm so tired of screwing up all the time. I always screw up. I haven't done anything good for myself, all I think about is having fun. But that always screws me up. Some times like now, I just wanna kill someone! My probation officer I'm not liking anymore. Sometime I wish I could just be gone and away. I hate living but on other cases I like it. But right now and lately I rather not live. It feels like I have few friends that actually care. I try my best to be a good friend. But some people don't care for it. Well I'm gunna go.
0	This week is my Spring Break. The events have been fun; movies, rpg, sleeping, and doing other things that require little effort. But it has also given me alot of time alone, which is great sometimes, but it means that I think about stuff. Now, thinking about stuff can be good and helpful and whatnot but it also drives me crazy. It fuels my insanity and produces thoughts that couldn't be further from the truth and yet I still take them seriously and put actual thought into it.   I'm fighting the darkness............and getting pulled deeper into it every day...
0	Where your job  really ,   really  ,    reallllly    sucks the big one?  This is one of those days.
1	Okay, more lyrics:   Love Song     In the place my wonder comes from There I find you Your face shines in my sky   In your heart where the world comes from There you will find me Your eyes dance in my mind   Come with me We will sail on the wind We will sway among the yellow grass When you be beside me I am real   Though my eyes be closed forever Still I would find you You shine across my time   Come with me We will sail on the wind We will sway among the yellow grass When you be beside me I am real   In the place my wonder comes from There I find you    --Bruce Cockburn,  High Winds, White Sky , 1971

0	What a fun day.  I got up, and the next thing you know dad is here to fix the toilet.  riveting stuff.  After that I went to shawn's house, and jizzed around there for a bit.  After the jizzing, most people came back here for a swim, and to review photos from last night's pimping good time.  Post review, a trip to the blue lotus on park road was made, raddest ice cream ever.  Then on to simon's house where we watched "But I'm a Cheerleader".  Everyone was friggin owned after that so we all sat around for a bit and soaked up the cool breeze. (meanwhile, there's no replacement for a good air conditioner)  yeah.
1	I checked out the Vagina Monologues on Sat. night(and no it's NOT a male bashing production).  It was in this cool red brick theatre, very rare to see in Taiwan.  Basically the show was about vaginas...go figure? There were 10 women on stage sharing stories about their vaginas....and yes it was quite funny.  I rolled on the floor with laughter a few times.  My favorite was the "angry vagina".  If it comes to a theater near you, I definitely recommend it.    Other than that I had a fabulous wk-nd.  The weather was great(I wore flip flops, capri's, and a tank top yesterday!)and I spent my wk-nd wisely.
1	i am going to my first Radiohead concert tomorrow - in Hamburg!!  lovely  wanna come?
0	I missed Pancake Tuesday.  With the pancakes and the ice-cream and the sugar and the pancakes and the pancakes... oh lord the pancakes... why has this happened to me??  *Sniffles*
1	Today is mine and Logan's one year anniversary. It doesn't even seem like it's been a year. But, alas, it has. :D I need to update my picture up there in the corner; it's a little out of date. that's from back in July!! Haha! We don't really have any special plans. Just to exchange gifts! (don't ask, cause I'm not gonna tell) We'll probably end up going to my church's Fall Celebration. Woo! What a way to spend our anniversary. Oh well. It'll be fun. That's just a quick update.   Oh, we're still winning in football. The game Friday (homecoming) was 62-0. It was sad. They didn't even stop the clock 2d half at all. It got done at 9:15!! so exciting!!   Anyway, I'm gonna go and call Logan here in a little bit to tell him the game plan. Later guys!  *emily*  eLmO!! 1 year and still going strong!
1	I must admit that life is gooood!! It's been a while, but I'm back!

1	  This LJ is my private journal.  Only polls will be made public.      All I ask is that:       You are not a psychotic stalker;    You are not born before 1980 (exceptions are seldomly made);    You accept me as your new overlord.       So, if you meet the criteria and wish to be added, leave a comment and add me.   ONE LAST THING:  a friend of a friend of a friend and so on... is a friend of mine.  That's all for now! 
1	ok all ideas that i'll elope are so gone! elyse and holly have been looking at engagement rings and wedding dresses and stuff tonight. i want a wedding! i dont' want to get married, just the wedding. i want a wedding! hehe
1	Dan and I have been *blushes* quite intimate with each other. I guess for the most part, I can say we are dating each other. It's kinda funny that I've known him for some time now, and we're dating now.. It's like... I don't know. Indescribable. I guess I've always liked him, but tried to deny it. There were times when we'd get close and flirty, but couldn't go any further. Just because he'd be seeing someone or I'd be seeing someone or both.  But I'm glad we're finally together.  In other news, I'm totally buying a puppy. Because they are  SO  cute.
0	I don't know what it is, but tonight is just too tough. All I have been able to think about is Tom. It's wierd I know, but I just can't stop wondering if he thinks about me at all.  If it is at all possible for me to forget about him and move on with my life.  I got asked out by a really cool kid at work today.  I instantly started crying and had to walk away. It made me feel like crap.  It wasn't because this guy asked me out, it was the harsh fact of reality that hit at that moment.  I'm single.  I'm allowed to date other guys.  The thing is, I don't want to. I hate this soooo much.  LIFE SUCKS!!!!!!!
0	Yesterday was one of the worst days ever. I have never had such a shitty day in my life. Once something good happens something totally horrible comes along and ruins it. It always happens to me just when I think that things are going good and I'm happy again, just one little thing goes wrong and I am back where I started.  fuck.  I really hope that today is better.
0	Tonight at around 10:45 my phone rang it was my relative Nikki thanking me for the work I've been doing at her husband's law firm, then I gave the phone to my dad and the news was confirmed Uncle Cy had died. Yes, I know he was old and sick but it still hurts a lot. I remember going to their house after visiting my grandma or on the way to a family friends house in Union New Jersey and seeing and being in awe of their Victorian well decorated house, and all their stuff teddy bears.  The bears always brought a smile to my face as well as the stories they told of my Grandma (my dad's mom) and Aunt.
1	Merry Christmas to everyone!  I hope everyone's was as good as mine was.  =)
1	I just went to a 24 hour walmart, and for the price of a gamecube game, which is why i went in the first place, i got what i have needed since it was invented. a dvd player for my room. YES. I have awesome speakers and now i am able to watch a dvd in my room. I never really did because the only way was to watch it off my old PS2 that no longer works, and the video cable for some reason or another would go really dark then really light, but anyway...My room has been pimped, i can now watch scary movies and actually enjoy them. my living room doesnt get verry dark...anyway, that is all and there is a mini bag of popcorn waiting for me...that is right, they now make smaller bags of popcorn, for those losers like me who end up watching movies alone. but anyway...
1	I just found out today that they are not selling the practice!  That they are going to continue on their original plan which was to expand the practice!  I WILL HAVE MY JOB!!!!!!!!  YEAH!!!!!

0	I love liars. I don't know why, but I always tend to go for the liars, and not even know it. There is nothing I hate more than lieing. I expect you to be truthful with me, if I am truthful with you. I've been nothing but truthful to you. I've been nothing but fooled once again. Once again, I believe words somebody said to me, I really have to learn not to do that. Nobody has ever given me a reason to trust anybody, than I try.. And I actually do, and they just prove me to be right again, you can't trust anybody.  I think I might become a cronic liar. That's it, I'll just lie about EVERYTHING. Hey, I'm lieing right now, because truthfully, I know that I can't do that.
1	I loved you; and perhaps I love you still, The flame, perhaps, is not extinguished; yet It burns so quietly within my soul, No longer should you feel distressed by it. Silently and hopelessly I loved you, At times too jealous and at times too shy. God grant you find another who will love you As tenderly and truthfully as I.  -Russian Poet  Wow, it just makes me feel good.
0	Today is crap, yesterday was crap, what is the hopes for tomorrow? I'm sitting here on the bed painting my toenails. The paint is red, like the blood spilling from my aching heart. He left me. He questioned my love and then he was the one to leave?  There is cotton between my toes, I'm thinking how the cotton relates to my friends. sort of holding me up and keeping me from smearing the polish.   The polish is drying now, alot like my tears. I hate when you've cried all day and your face is streaked with stinging salt. A shower would do me good. And I'm sure to go soon.  The paint is hardening now, but I'll keep it from affecting my heart.  Love Rach
1	I am in a remarkably good mood today.  Max got back from his trip yesterday . And he has already called 4 times. I thinking about starting on my spring cleaning. Never actually got it started , just thought about it.
1	It's been a long time since that party so long ago where we met, and I'm still so glad that I got a chance to meet you. You are very smart, talanted, kind, and all around a wonderful person to know. You've brought a lot of happiness into my life, and I've missed you a lot during the times when you weren't around. It's been a great few years, and I hope we'll be in each other's lives for a long time more. :) *hugs you tight*  あなたは私のねこです。私はあなたのきつねです。
1	It's funny how sometimes you assume the worst and get something sweet instead.  (Satyr's Note: Hm... not enough to warrant a title and a label of poetry or (terribly short) prose. But I felt like writing it.  Why don't I ever write longer things anymore?)
0	The little 16-month-old Afghan boy who traveled to Indianapolis with his father to correct a heart defect died today.  All I was able to find was that WISH 8's Pam Ellis, who is in Afghanistan, had reported that the boy died.   Aw.  He was doing so well, too.  And darn it, was he the cutest baby ever.  I don't even know if he had reunited with his mother yet...he only left Indy earlier this week, I think.  Aw.
0	   Somebody tell this to the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). Tell them to take a leaf out out of Dad's book...    By 9:15 am today, they had cut down at least eight full-grown trees near the race course, to accomodate the Anand Rao Circle fly-over... Many more should have followed by now.  Sad. All in the name of "development".
1	Well, I just saw Peter for the second time this month.  It was really nice to see him again.  We went to Starbucks and got something to drink and then looked around Barnes & Noble.  It was really nice to see him.  Hopefully, he'll be taking drawing class every Wednesday in Pasadena this summer, so that's good in terms of being able to see him.  Other than that, I'm just gearing up for the performance on Friday at 12 PM.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  We're just practicing a lot so that our sound is good.  Well, that's about it for now.  I'll leave you with a quote by Kontetsuken.  "heroes with a puff-ball... MOOGLE POWER!" -      kontetsuken

This features the lovely ladies of S.H.E., the most popular Chinese group ... or at least from what I thought when I went back to China this winter break XDDD.  This layout is kinda plain... which is pretty disappointing since it's the big THREE OH.  Oh well...  I love google's images come holiday time!  Here's the one for Chinese New Year!       I remember last year's with the lamb taking a bite out of the O.  So cute ^__^

1	nothing much to say but...Dana waved at me today before she left (driving her car). that was so sweet...
0	this was a really emotional day for me and im not one to get emotional too much but today was an exception. michael's mom called and asked if i would come over and help clean out his room since they are going to be packing up his things to get it out of there.  i was so not prepared for it. just when you think you have gotten slightly over someone's death there is that one thing that puts you right back in that spot. it was so hard to sit there and go through all this stuff that we used to laugh and joke about with each other. his mom told me i could take whatever i wanted since she knew how much most of his stuff meant so i took his blue M&M character and all his M&M stuff plus a few other things that were inside jokes between us.  it's been almost 8 months and i still miss him so much. he was my very best friend and a piece of me died with him.   ~i'll see you up there buddy. I love you.~
0	So I came home from school and my dog didn't run to the door.  I figured that my sister had left her door closed or something and that she had just fallen asleep in her room.  My dad called a little later and told me she was sick and asked how she was doing... so I went over to her and her breath was really short and the sist on her stomach had seemed to have grown about 2 times.  It's really hard now and the skin is all funny colored.   My mom just took her to the vet and wouldn't let me go because she thought that they might be putting her to sleep.   Wow.  This really really really sucks.
1	Who wants to come all the way to New York to go to the POA premiere with Eli, Storm and me? XD!  Come on, you know you want to.  Storm says she's willing to provide crash-space for people if they need it, even though she lives in Delaware (which surprisingly, is not that far from the City).  Oh, and the premiere is on Sunday, May 23rd. I think that's Memorial Day weekend. Check  here  for more details.
1	The Crashin' With Good Charlotte thing was great! Just what I needed. Especially since Benji was wearing that hat I love..*humps* ANNNYWAY...it was great when Benji and Joel were in the girls room screwin' around with all of their stuff...lol it was great. The best was when Benji was just laying there looking at the posters and goes..."hot guys." lol So funny!!   I'm also pretty sure that Chris and I are meant to be together...lol I fucking love him!! He was so wearing the Mest hoodie I was trying to win on Ebay, I was jealous! lol   Anyway...I'm on a wicked The Young & The Hopeless kick (song, not album) I mean I've had it on repeat for awhile...it's probably because of the David Letterman performance of it I randomly found one day...*wooo*
1	Every so often we all decide to have a network gaming session and this time it's at Chez Stu and Suz. Courtesy of work we have a shiny new DL560 (quad Xeon) running as the dedicated server and the house looks like it's been wrapped in network cable. Still - we must be getting better at this as all the machines were setup the night before leaving today free for gaming.  Off to a 120th Birthday Party tonight - four people are having their 30th's in the netx month and they've decided to combine them into one party. Still unsure as to whether I should drink or not (I'm starting to err on the side of alcohol) but we'll see.   Oh - six days till Assemblage 23! yay!

1	Well I'm at the library at school.  I like it here and I like all my classes but writing.  That professor is insanely annoying.  I have an hour break then I'm going to Subway with Ann and possibly Cody.    I really like working at the pool. Everybody's so nice there.  It's sweet 'cause I basically get paid to work out.  Hah.  Teaching at the studio is going really well too.  I LOVE teaching tap.  I'm so excited about it.    I just watched the Briget Jones sequel preview.  It looks so funny.  I can't wait.  I've been anticipating quite a few movies and books lately.    Went up to Western last weekend and was slightly dissappointed because of the lack of partying.  Hmm.  We'll have to make up for it next time I guess.  Well it's about time to go meet Ann.  Bye.
1	You can see some pictures of my wings *in action* in   this entry.   And just for the record, my customers are awesome (=
0	I'm not much for christianity, but it makes no difference what religion someone is when they're as inspiring as the pope was through his lifetime.  I'll always admire who he was, but for now, I'll leave the poetic farewells to the rest of the world.
1	just wanted to say that today is a really good day. i have been feeling great!!! people i have been noticing use the word hate is so many different contexts that the meaning has been changed around all together, yet the word itself still has powerful meaning behind it. hate is the root of all evils. ;-) but yeah that is all i had to say.  p.s. my family is doing great now!!! i love you all very much. thanks to everyone who said a prayer for me and my family.

0	I had a lovely day with my sister, who was intent on spoiling me. I have alot of new clothes. Hm.   But I don't know what's happened now. I feel a bit down. I think part of it is reading through Sakki having her art stolen, then following Aido's thread. I feel kinda depressed about the whole thing. Which is not good, because I don't feel like drawing, and I have a lot of art to WORK on. Not even for fun.   I feel sad. Just ignore it. I'll go have dinner and try rewriting my lecture notes.
1	 First, because I won't be online again until Monday, I want to wish       rileyc    a very     Happy Birthday!!!!     Hope the furballs give you the gift of a peaceful Sunday (maybe you can just fill their little tummies with tuna and let them sleep the day away).    Second,  THANK YOU SO MUCH  for my birthday story ("Head Over Heels" prequel) and for the news that you're going to be writing more of this fic.&nbsp; I love Elliot/Toby (*hugs Elliot/Toby*).&nbsp; I didn't get a chance to read the story today (had to do my income taxes at lunch), so I'm looking forward to sitting down with it this evening at home.&nbsp; I'll have more to say on Monday.&nbsp;     Finally, don't forget to check your P.O. box.&nbsp; ;-) 
1	    This puppets were handmade with love by       malmostosa    (also check       filoillogico    for some more of her amazing work) who was inspired by   Bruttavita   and made a little Bruttavita family  and then gave them to us, so that we can use them for next year's issue. Aren't they totally cool?
1	Here's a few flowers. My Christmas cactus is in full bloom again!     
1	Well, the quarter is almost finished.  Only three more days of classes and then I'm done.  Well, not quite yet.  I still have to take finals, but then I'll be finished.  FINISHED!  Tomorrow, I have the last of the four performances that I am in this weekend.  Although it's nice to finally be through with them, it still makes me sad and yet happy at the same time that this is the culmination of all my efforts for the past few months.  I've been drawing some more recently.  I've been trying to copy what I've seen in various comics in order to get a sense of how to move my paw.  It's not going so well, but then again I didn't expect it to.  I'm tired now.  I should really go to bed.  Tomorrow will be a day of singing and CD ripping.  Goodnight!

1	Dad's gonna be gone for the weekend, he is going to help grandma with some horror show convention (cuz she was in night of the living dead.) So he gave me 50 bucks for food, I spent 30 at Target on yougurt, canned fruit and more helthly stuff, and used the last 20 for gas...(and that just barely filled it up!) damn gas prices... $2.16!!!  P is gonna be here the whole weekend, she says she is gonna cook for me and stuff... I can't wait!  I have to go to work at 6...so I'm just hanging out til then. I went to the gym and did another mile, this time I didn't improve my time, my legs hurt too bad. I did 30 laps though, and had some peaches, so I'm good.  Yesterday I had a smoothie, and that was is. I woke up at 3:23 this morning and felt the urge to do some sit ups. So I did 50 and went back to bed.   Bored  d

0	For those of you who knew Bill Phillips...  I found his obituary online.  Here is the link.   http://www.legacy.com/latimes/LegacySub Page2.asp?Page=LifeStory&PersonId=3089401  .  I think we ought to send a card or something.  I know we haven't seen them in a long time, but we horsie girls knew him for a long time, and I think the family would appreciate the gesture.  Let me know what you think.  I will try to find their address.  I think for no other reason, we owe at least a little something to Jessie.  Friends... even ones that have become distant or even estranged, ought to be there for each other during hard times.
1	k so i picked up my prom dress and it looks hot-dress.....MMMMMCSIHCGSCIV...needs more turmeric. that was excellent. i kept doin git to bo in gym and he pretty much urinated...we pretty much both did.   anywho, this weekend was awesome. saturday i went to baldwin park with bets whereupon we found a soccer ball and took pictures of it in various places liek the expedia.com gnome commercials. then we took art shots of us on swings. we pretty much just hiked around and went exploring. then we went to the thrift mart where i got a cool pendant and to carvel where i got a fizzler and we waved to peopel drivign by. then i went to danes' for a dinner party and i met matt and i think hes funny.   sunday i hung out with man and we went to the mall and probably other things i dont remember.  im soooo excited to go to emerson on wednesday. i cant wait to relive the magic.

1	Well the Provigil seems to be working.  Only one narcaleptic like attack last week, the attacks now seem to be downgraded to being incredably spaced, but I get away with that I just pretend to be having a great-idea.  talking of spaced.  Anyone know why my bowser should keep trying to go to another site when I try to fill in my journal? (I keep needing to press the back button to complete it.)  heather :)

0	there are no useful drugs to help from feeling numb.   i've felt like crying for most of the day but it just isnt happening.
0	My fucking bike has just been stolen yet I'm 100% certain that I locked up the damn bastard as well. despite this when I went to the lamppost I locked it to all that could be found was the chain and padlock apparently untouched. How the fuck did this happen I know I locked up the bloody bike and it cost me £50. Considering recent events it appears that my old saying is true after all "If it has tits or wheels you will have trouble with it  eventually".
1	  I was so excited these last 3 day cause I finally got to play Wild Arms 3 but I ended up getting stuck in this one stage so I was really frustrated and I had to return it so I never got the chance to really figure it out but I totally LOVE IT, and Virginia is the coolest character! Clive was cool too with his casual attitude and all, but I don't want to spoil any of the game got any of you peoples but I will say that it is a must play! I just have to get it now. Yuri said she tried so hard for like hours to pull me away from it and that I was like addicted to it lol. I couldn't help it though. I've always loved Wild Arms and now that they finally have a girl for the hero I am that much more excited about it! I just gotta have it! &gt;. 
0	well i woke up this morning hoping to do something couldn't go anywhere cause my mom wouldn't drive; the roads were icy exc. couldn't walk anywhere because my mom said it was unsafe; weather was "blistering" windy i understand her point just not happy with it owell always tomorrow

1	   Red  is of course the color of love and passion, but also of chivalry and courage.  Orchids  represent fervour and eroticism. You are a very romantic person, your aim in life is love and be loved, but with respect and deep feelings.      What flower - color association are you?     brought to you by  Quizilla

0	I am so tired today that I want to go back to bed and fall asleep. My bed is so comfortable and I fall asleep right away. That is how comfortable my bed is. I am so sad too because I found out that my cousin has passed away and me and my family have been praying for him and saying the rosary. I am so sad that he is gone. He was a loveable and caring person and he was the kind of person that would give you hugs all the time when you see him. He was a loving person too. I miss him to much. (Sob) I think and pray for him all the time.
0	Feeling a little sad here....   Just watched a video diary from Pete Jackson about Kong.  And though it looks marvelous, there was this bittersweet nostalgia for LOTR.  Not to watch it or missing it (there's a part of it that always stays inside), no it was the "goodbyes" they were having for Jack Black and some other actor that got a Maori *hauka* (though I don't know how to spell that or even it that's the right word).  But I thought... THAT is the goodbye for Viggo... not this guy.  Not for those actors.  Not for that movie. I didn't really want to hear Dan Hannah about the "New York" sets and how they will save the pieces for another movie.....  I just watched in this little pathetic state about "no... not them... it's NOT the same as LOTR"  it can't be the same as lotr...  I respect PJ.  I love what he does with film.  I love how he treats his actors.  But LOTR was like a family and...  Okay enough.
1	I've been getting a lot of warm regards from  you  because my sweetie,       estherchaya    posted to wish me a happy birthday.  I suspect it won't be long before she calls  her friendslist  a bunch of bastards for being smartasses.  And she'd be right.  Crude, but right.  It's strange.  All along I'd thought that   my friendslist   was the highest concentration of bastards on Livejournal.  I guess things have shifted.
0	I feel like shit today.  Like I do everyday.  I slept a lot today and most of the day I didn't know if it was a dream or reality.  I got another high score on tetris.  I started to read Harry Potter, Chrissy gave me all of the books for my birthday.  I got a new T.V. for my birthday because my old one was dying.  How material possessions can make you so happy.  Many of my gifts were clothes, are you guys trying to give me hints about something?  My birthday was pretty good thanks dudes.  I think I might go live up at the beach house for awhile.  I think it would do me some good not to be here for awhile.    I hung out with Brit tonight when we were out some twenty-something guy was trying to hit on me and she was cracking up the whole time.  It was pretty funny.    My mormon grandma is living with us.  Now I have a strict second mother.     I feel like shit because of people, bastards.
1	So I just got done watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for the first time. I was really scared to watch it because everyone kept talking about how amazing it was, and I thought it wouldn't live up to my expectations. But I thought it was amazing. :) That's about all I can say about it.   I'm exhausted, I opened and went and worked out with my mom this morning. I don't have to be at work until 9 AM tomorrow because Sarah is awesome and said she would open for me. :) So, I think I'm going to go return these movies and get a few more and then veg and watch movies until I pass out. Which will probably be 8 PM. Heh.   Anyways. That's about it.
1	How lovely is the snow storm! That drapes the world in light, And comes from places far away To whisper in the night. That snow that ices all the roads Turns traffic into a quiet ballet, Cars spin silently off the streets While children run and play.   We got a snowday. Yay! I got to sleep late and stuff. I'm going to call the wheather man and get him to forecast a storm every Friday. Oh and Monty Python is god. Barry and I watched a few episodes of the first season of Flying Circus last night. I don't think I've ever laughed that hard. These past two days have been awesome.
1	i spent this morning looking at double wide mobile homes.  some of them are AWESOME inside.  i found one with vaulted ceilings and a fireplace i LOVED.  it came with everything too - fridge, stove,...  big screen tv.  hehe.  sooooo, for $65,000 i'm doing some serious consideration as of which hinges on the availability of the property i have in mind.  my dad and i have been crunching numbers and all seems plausable being the matrix will be paid off this summer and a roommate is just waiting to move in.  exciting.  an actual home, that's mine, that i can do as i please with (murals and dogs...  the possibilities are endless... lol)  hmmm....  i'm going to go see about that property now...  hehe
0	Abused. :-/  I really don't know what to write. SO much crap going on lately and I'm constantly in a bad mood. I just can't seem to get out of it. I have cried a lot lately, have had my friends trying to cheer me up but I'm a stubbourn bitch and don't listen to any of it, obviously. I just can't seem to get all of their encouraging words into my head. It's like I hear it but it goes straight through my head. I want to know what happened to the me of like last week, when I was so happy and proud of myself for it. Obviously it just kind of flew away. I really don't know what I'm going to do with myself anymore. I have a med check soon, hopefully it will help me a bit, keeping my moods steady. I just have to get Brittany out of her mood as well -sigh- It just never ends.
1	Here it is Sunday afternoon and I'm not sure what I did this weekend.  Last weekend, SCCA.  The weekend before, curling.  This weekend.  Um...I rode my bike Friday evening.  And I sat around and did a lot of nothing.  But that's okay.  After feeling rushed for the last several weeks, I needed a weekend to unwind and do nothing.  Curling and SCCA were fun, but not having any demands on your time is nice.  Everything I needed to do for school is done.  Got some stuff to do, but nothing pressing and I don't see a bunch of stuff piling up next week, so I'm taking a break.  I think my good mood has to do with the end of the semester coming up.  It happened at the beginning of December last term and now, with just a few weeks left, I'm feeling better than the everyday feeling.  I'm getting there.  On one hand, June seems so far away.  On the other, it's hard to believe that it was only a month ago I was in Pennsylvania.  Time flies nowdays.
1	Okay, first, you can download Tuomas’s kick ass theme for the Finnish Kitee team baseball here:   http://www.nightwish.com/files/KiPa.m p3  This is a band who listens to their fans. We all loved the bit we heard on the DVD and now they put it up on the web for us!  Also, if you’re really bored… here is Nightwish (minus Tarja, I might add!) dancing naked around a Christmas tree:  http://www.nightwish.com/files/naku10.w mv   Their recordings for the new album orchestra will be done in Phoenix Studios, in London, using the same orchestra Howard Shore used for the LOTR trilogy!   And there will be another Finnish language song o the new album!  Much gushiness…
1	it's been a while since i've written in here. not in school anymore. just working. looking for a new job at the moment also. me and my long lost friend lorna have found eachother again! and you people say myspace is bad! i'm looking forword to being better friends with her and see her more often. sf isn't that far away!
0	This story got left behind.  And it's really quite sad.  On March 31, Fred Korematsu, affectionately called the "Asian Rosa Parks", the man who stood up against Japanese internment when he himself a US citizen became interned during World War II, died at the ripe old age of 86.   http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/natio nal/01korematsu.html   Unlike Rosa Parks, the civil rights that were violated for Korematsu and the other 120,000 Japanese Americans during that time period were never even acknowledged let alone rectified until well into the 1990s.

1	   YAY! V.I.P. Escort Party !!  (and I'm invited, I feel so special)  ...Sure wish Gaston was here to go with me... 
1	Well, we have a harp visiting us, anyway. We're looking after Gwens big wirestrung harp Heretic while she's off in Singapore, though just until Tim comes to take him (?) away so Annie can actually give him proper TLC and some excercise (since the most I can do is admire the harp and pluck the occasional string - not the kind of thing likely to make a harp accostomed to talented fingers happy.  While we were visiting Gwen, Joe & Gavin to collect said harp (they're remarkably organised and taking remarkably little with them for people going away for 4 months) we also gave them a good laugh by delivering pink towels. Fuschia pink. Really, really pink. She won't be able to miss the fact she now has pink towels :-) My work here is done. The Allcocks have struck. Hurrah!
1	YEAH!!! HAPPY NEW YEARS EVE!!! Woot woot..well just a real quick update...christmas was lots of fun..time to spend with the family! LOVE IT!!!!  It seems like my time here in fremont has flown by soo quick. But it has been loads of fun. Now only 3 more days until i leave to Virginia...YIKES! Im not even all packed or anything...but i am way excited and nervous at the same time. i keep having dreams about being in Utah though..hum. Well i hope everyone has a Happy New Years!!! Be safe!!! tootles
1	so i went driving yesterday, and im going to go again in about 30 min. im surprisingly ok at it, probably because ive driven golf carts and stuff, which has also made me a lot less scared.   i have 2 basketball games tonight so that should be..whats the word im looking for...oh hell! oh and something even more upsetting is that mom, being the thoughtful person that she is decided to invite my grandma and grandpa, who are crazy! if you've met them or ive told you stories of them, you know how bad this is. well i have to go buy something pink for my big sister on dance squad, hehe i get to drive there!
1	Yay its jareds favorite person right now, except for maybe angie, there most likely tied at the moment, oh well he made me take the test and here are the results...       Which Avril Lavigne Song Are You?  
0	I mess everything up...And that which a don't doesn't go right anyway...  I have solo & ensamble tommorow, which is going to last all day for me... the only good thing is that I can probably do my Bassoon Solo in march, at the Sparta festival, because my private teacher is the Sparta HS band director.  And yesterday, in my S&E concert, i did fine in the Jazz Band section of it, but somehow, my only good bassoon reed was cracked, so it's useless now. I think someone accidentally did it, refilled my soaker, and hoped I wouldn't notice....well, I did. I have to drop my Band Choir piece down an octave because on my old reeds I can not hit a high high Bflat anymore (4 ledger lines above the staff....High).
0	It's a sad day. I thought Danny was lying. But it's true. Noah Wyle is leaving ER.  ::SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOB::  At least there is still hot Dr Luca. :-\
0	Jesus Christ. I just heard that  Hunter S Thompson  committed suicide tonight. His books and movies have met so much to me and completely changed my life. I never thought it would be possible for me to ever be a writer because I don't possess the ability to stay on a single target for very long. Then I read his books and I realized how similar my writing is to his and that I really can write, just maybe not in the traditional sense. Now I'm working on a book, thanks to his inspiration, and have several more in mind. Plus it was all because of him that I got into politics too. God, I don't know whether to feel extremely sad and depressed about this news or just pissed off at him for taking himself away from all of us who appreciated him and his writings so much. Oddly, I just watched an interview with him on Conan last night. This is a true loss to me and I know he will be missed. I didn't know him, but it will take me a while to get over this one.
0	Happy birthday dude. Yesterday/today we had a blast and hope to see many more days like this.
1	Things I need to make:  1) A ventriloquist dummy  2) A blowtorch  3) A windmill  4) A book  5) A burned CD  6) Mutagen or Terrigen Gas  7) A baby  8) Money for the me  9) A way to make you believe I was only kidding about 9  10) A digital Camera picture that I've been planning forever but have yet been able to make. ERR!!!!  11) A way to live happily.  12) A smile   PS- The last one just got duun   PSS- Get 'er done.

So we ended up watchin Donnie Darko and The Ring. Good movies and gots close to Sharon so it was all in all a really good night...besides the fact that it was cold...but hey...oh well. Hopefully we get to do that again soon....just next time....VHS.  Goin to bed now...or attempt it. Work tomorrow til' 5pm. Damn Corprates!!!

Both are female, fixed and frontal declawed.  ETA:  The long hair is now spoken for.  Thank goddess for mommies.

1	   Here's  Kim  and me with cutie pie  Ben Kweller  after his concert this past Friday night - it was so cool!     and here is me and Little T (the lead singer from  Little T and One Track Mike ).  He was so nice and told me that his first love was named Leslie.  So that was cool.  I know the picture is a little dark, but you can still tell it's us.  By the way, did you notice his Radish shirt?  (BK's old band)
0	i hate this. i was just starting to get over it and then for some reason it came back. those of you who dont know what im talking about sorry. some of you know tho. i was better. i was. and now its back to just sucking. everyday i go through only to try to not dwell on things. but inevitably i do. and it sucks. i wish i could take it back. i wish i could fix it.   people should call me to cheer me up. 301-793-2224.

0	if this is as bad as i think it is, i'm going to slip into another depression. this time i have friends who care and will help me through it. lisa i need you now. my heart is in my stomach. (by the way, friday was fun lisa, we must do that again)  please dont be mad, this isnt supposed to make you feel bad or guilty. i am not mad at you, i knew this was coming, i just wish it didnt until we actually met eachother. i dont know why im posting this, i care about you so much. i miss you. i need you. and i UNDERSTAND that you need him and he needs you. i want you to be happy, so be so. i still want to talk to you every night, about nothing in particular. i'll always be here for you. i dont know if you can say the same, and i dont expect you to.   um... sincerely,  tony
1	So, some of you know Prodigal Boy, my online name for my younger brother.  Those of you who know him probably know he is currently living in Wisconsin.  Well, he's landing at the Sea-Tac Airport at 4:35 pm today, and is out here visiting all of his old friends for a week.  He'd love to see everyone, and may drag me to a social event or two (Sat. night game), so if you want to get in touch with him, let me know.
1	Wait, can someone tell me where I'm going in about 6 hours?  O yeah, that's right.....NEW YORK CITY!!!!  What now biotch?  I'm so stoked.  My first time to the Big Apple.  I'm actually kinda scared too though.  It's my first recruiting trip so I don't really know what to expect.  But hey, Mike Nelson and Mat Rothway both go there, so at least I'll be surrounded by hot boys!!!  Anywho, I hope you guys don't miss me too much.  It will be tough to survive, I know, but when your days feel dark and gray, just picture my smiling face and everything will be ok.  Or just listen to John Mayer.  That will always make you feel happy!!  In honor of my trip, I will leave you with a quote from the song City Love which was written about New York. "I tell everyone I smile just because I've got a city love I found it in Lydia And I can't remember life before her name" John told me he wanted to put my name in instead of Lydia, but it didn't rhyme.  O well. You know you love me ~kirsten

0	I do those so often. I say things without thinking and hurt people's feelings. I know being honest is a good quality, but sometimes I am too honest. I think I will go bury my head in the bed sheets, hide myself from the world, and cry. I am so stupid sometimes.
1	I went to a candy store today. Found a little something that I think Tyler Smith would appreciate.
1	Wowowww !!! The India Pakistan Series starts from tomorrow... oops today. It will be so exciting once again, though I think one cannot really expect anything out of both the teams as they generally are on a roller coaster ride. Waiting for the greart tense moments and the matches.  Hope it would be as good as the series which India won in Pakistan  Gear up India!!! You can do it !!!

1	I am getting my raise.  Not only am I getting my raise, but it's being applied retroactively so that the problem is actually fixed.  Not only are they fixing the problem, but I am getting backpay for all of it!  Thank heavens, I might actually be able to get a haircut this year.
0	i need to write something. my soul is suffocating, i can feel it in my bones. it's screaming out for someone to listen, or just the simple joy of release that comes when you do talk. i feel dreary. i feel like crying. i'm not really depressed, but i just feel so incredibly sad. perhaps listening to old Modest Mouse and Placebo CD's isn't helping. bleh
1	Okay, so it's been forever since I posted but I thought I'd give it a go. So much has changed since my last post. I'm living with Jenn, still very much in love. We are both very happy with each other and looking forward to the future. School is coming along, as is work. I'm working on moving up to a Level 2 position which would be nice. I'd be a manager, so that would kick some ass...not to mention the pay raise. Other then that everything is pretty smooth. I spend most of my time in work and with Jenn. We have a lot of plans for the summer, so I've got much to look forward to. Right now, I'm just trying to get through this semster and go from there. Maybe I'll take a summer course but that depends on if I get the promotion or not. Well, I can't think of much else to say but when I do I'll write it.
1	Hehe, I found some new icons.  Aren't they fabulous?  Yay!
1	I did end up venturing out of my drunken comfort zone and headed out to Waverton to watch the midnight fireworks with an onobstructed view of the bridge. They were really pretty ... and if it wasnt for that stupid national anthem remix they would have been a lil better.  Plus that ball ... it did look kinda odd just  dangling there .  it should have exploded in a ball of fireworks or something. that would have been cool.  but i reakon they were one of the best ive seen for a while. i like how they were also scattered around the harbour, not just focused on the bridge.  ive heard so many people say (and ive probably said it myself) that the best view of the fireworks is on tv... but thats just a peice of crap.  get out of your armchairs people and see the real thing :P
0	Well here we go...   1. Got to work today and guess what, we have to work on Thanksgiving... There go my plans of spending the holiday with my family. The Air Force takes care of me so well, can't you tell?? Can you feel the hatred... no, because you are reading this... but it is there, believe me. I'm trying to take leave though, but then again I have been trying to take leave for about 3 months now.   2. Above is good news compared to what is comming next... My baby blew her clutch today :(... Yep out of nowhere I was driving and the clutch just gave out... Why me??? Why do i have to recieve the worst luck out of anybody on this planet. Bah!!! I hate life, with a passion... if I have any?? Just shoot me now and end this misery.

1	   HAPPY BIRTHDAY APRILLILY     You have been such a warm, welcoming friend to me.  You are a talented writer, a hard worker, a multi-tasker.  You are someone that cares, passionately, about your family, boyfriend, friends...even your characters!  I am always deeply impressed by your intelligence, open mindedness, empathy towards others and so much more.  I hope this year will bring you many wonderful things, not least of which is a finished thesis!  Best wishes, April.
1	I got a job at the thrift store! Yaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	It's the week before finals now. Next week is finals week and then spring break for me. Woo. It's rather amusing watching everybody freak out because they've finally decided to start on the work they have to do and gave themselves such little time for it. All of my classes have little assignments every week or class or so and a take home final that is barely worth more than one of the assignments, so I'm not stressed out at all about it. Kinda sucks though cause everybody is too stressed out to want to hang out much at all. A bunch of my friends are gonna be taking a road trip to Mexico over spring break. I decided too late that it would be nifty to join them, and their car is already too full. So I'm just gonna wander back home and visit with people there. It's probably gonna be a pretty cool break.  Also, I heard a rumor that Screamworks is gonna be putting on a big thing in SF sometime around the 24th. Anybody know if that's still going to be happening?
0	My stepdad just left. He stormed in drunk, started rambling about some crap, how I was talking about my parents behind their back, and some B.S. like that.  Threatened to slap me if i ever did it again.  None of it really made any sense. What is this world's fucking problem?  What good has alcohol ever done to anyone?  Why the fuck does anyone use it?  After all this shit alcohol has done to millions of people over thousands of generations?  Why?  What the fuck is this world's damned problem?
0	 Raise Your Voice  Directed by  Sean McNamara  Review by       darksidebitca    ***  I was so disappointed in this.  That may seem like a funny statement, given that it's just another cutesy Hilary Duff movie. But see, it's a cutesy movie about singing, and I  like  Hilary Duff movies. Don't judge me. They're fun and cute and predictable and  nice .  But this? I couldn't get over the fact that she was accepted to this exclusive and important music school. And she can't sing all that well. It's okay enough for a cutesy pop star, but it's not something to get you into a serious conservatory. Even her rival, who supposedly had a superior voice, but not the same gripping backstory (which I wasn't terribly moved by, it just seemed very cliche), wasn't very good. They were all just too... pop-y. And while I can usually get around that for the sake of a cutesy movie, it just wasn't happening here.  *shrug*
1	so this weekend was fun.  I gots me a lego key chain!!! who hoo.  it's a pirate lego man.    So... I've been workin a lot on this freakin story boarding project.  BUt it's almost done with.  And I finished one of my projects today so yeah...  hopefully I wont be as busy tomorrow as I planned on being.   I'm gonna try to get some reps maid before we head to chronicles this weekend.  Fun fun, we're car pooling with hannah and tim.    but yeah, I'm gonna go play some CS with jeff and lulu now.  peace out.
1	Chillin at Angel's place in the Bronx. Yea yea.  Oh, and Carl is cool, woot.
1	Well, I'm very excited. I owled Viktor a little while ago about the Summer sessions, and in the process got an Owl from Cho, who apologized for her actions. And then Viktor invited me  and a friend  to come to Bulgaria with him for the next two weeks! Now, I could have invited Ron or Harry, but as Ron hates Viktor and we don't even know if Harry can leave yet, and the fact that we leave tomorrow, I invited Cho instead. I knew she'd love it, being the avid Quidditch fan that she is. I just can't wait to see him again.  Love, ~*Hermione
1	Okay, so here's the thing.  My absolute favorite band from my hometown has just released their first FULL LENGTH STUDIO ALBUM.  And it's fucking fantastic.  I was at the CD release party last night before I drove back to school, got the cd, and it's just ... so good.  The band is Stereo Agency, the album is Escape Plan, and here's some of their music to try out.   Dirty G   Voicemail   Everybody Has a Neighbor    They're mostly instrumental.  They don't really fit into one (or even two) genre of music, but it's all a huge wonderful comination of jazz, blues, rock, ambient and sometimes even latin fusion, hip-hop ... and whatever else they feel like doing.  They are also four of the nicest guys you will ever meet.  If you like the music, check out their website:  stereoagency.com   And that's my music PSA of the day
1	Well actually it's Aaron's favorite in the Good Stuff series....Good Stuff 4 that got the CD (and mp3) treatment. It's one of my VGM cassete tape projects from the late 90s that was great. Now it sounds a whole lot better on a CD thanks to some technology! So that's what I'm doing right now.  Other than that....not much else happened today. I'd be really happy if my princess came on my message board...like she has lately. So her prom is at the end of the next month....and she said she'll be fine despite not having me there cuz of our long distance iusse. That makes me feel better too, knowing she's got someone with her to keep my meggy out of harms way.   Oh great now I'm hungry. Guess I'll eat the last 2 chili dogs. How funny...I say that and I'm listening to sonic the hedgehog game music.....^^;
1	Only 3 days, 6 hours, 50 minutes, and 7 seconds left until the New Jersey Regional!
1	We are getting a tax refund!!!  Praise the Lord!!! Of course it will go to make a dent in the visa bill but YAHOO!!! Now nippy can get his stero installed in his car!  It has been sitting in the garage since his car got totalled by an uninsured driver last year.  We decided we would each get a small "treat". What do I want???????  Savings for the kids?  Screw that!  They can get school loans like we did!! Heheheheh!  Ah the visa bill and something little for me....Starbucks card?  Yum.  That would be nice.  A new umbrella stroller?  Perhaps....
1	    Saw the midwife today who did a swab and a vaginal check on me.  The swab showed that I have NOT ruptured membranes (meaning the amniotic sack is still intact) so this is a good thing.  The internal showed that the baby's head is engaged (meaning that he's in my pelvis and ready to come out) and that I am about 1cm dilated.  For those who don't know, we pregnant women dilate to 10cms before pushing the baby out.  So, we're on our way, but it still could be a week or two before I actually go into labour.  And there you have it!  Cheers,  Maggs
1	oh what a winter break i had...i didn't get to see all my friends like i wanted to...but it was still a good break away from school...  chic flics with miss chim chim walking with anjali staying up until 3am christmas morning baking cookies with mum lunch with taylor (whom i hadn't seen since last christmas) movies at tinseltown dinner at the new outback in o.r. closing down dollywood getting surprising IM's from ppl i hadn't talked to in 4ever NEW HAIR COLOR!  whee!!

0	Well, I had my first car crash this morning. Some lady ran a stop sign infront of me and I hit her in the side. I was very suprised as to how gentle the crash was, I was expecting a lot more violence and noise. I really wish the crash hadn't happened, my car is somewhat damaged. The front is bent, the right front door won't open, and when I sit in still traffic, the temperature goes up. The car of the girl who ran the stop sign had to be towed away. Well, I hope the insurance company stuff goes easy. So off for now.
1	Who got their license?  That's right, Sarah did.  Even though I almost killed us.  The guy is way easier than the lady.  To quote that guy that did that thing, "everything's going so well."  By BU official acceptance packet came today.  :).
1	hey everyone! i will be at my lake house till saturday with the girls, and brett and brad!  call me on the cell if you wanna talk or what ever!
0	...Just got a phonecall from one of my aunts, My great uncle Tom died last night in his bed after a brief illness.  He was in his mid 90's, though, so that makes it a lot easier on everyone. He'd led a long life with his wife, Joyce and his children...  I didn't see him that often, but he was such a kind, gentle fellow. He had this wonderful sense of stillness and peace about him, like he'd reached a point in his life where he was simply content with what he had, and was happy to spend his remaining days with his loving family.  I will miss him...
1	so yesterday (the 13th), or today, depending on how you look at it, was/is my twentieth birthday. my friends and I ended up going out to dinner at the middle eastern restaurant here, which was good.  umm...doesn't feel any different being twenty, yet. all it means is that I'm no longer a teenager but not truly an adult yet. so, yeah.  I finished naruto season 2 today, and now it is on to season 3. I really like naruto, although it takes things a couple of episodes each to finish each plot line.   umm....not much else beyond that, I suppose. I like spring, for obvious reasons. ummm I'm off to sleep now. hope all of you reading this (if anyone actually does) are having a good night. bye for now
1	Emmy's back! I went to the gully and she was there and I gave her my Secret of the Unicorn Queen books and she's not mad at me or anything! I'm so relieved! It would've been awful if she hadn't forgiven me, just awful.  I got a new icon! It's a fat bat!

0	a sad day this morning when, in my sociology class, we learned that Mr. Rogers passed away at the age of 74.  just hearing the gasps, one could see he was such an important part of our childhood.  i remember watching him right before sesame street would come on.  i learned so much from him, and in that half-hour, he would transport us into an imaginary world of peace.  he taught us to be confident and unafraid.  his affect on generations and generations will never be forgotton.   Rest in peace Mr. Rogers.
1	I have a new sweetie and her name is Ruthie. And she's definately the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.   Sweetie, when you read this, I want you to know how much you mean to me.  Hugs and smooches always.
1	Is my newest fish. A few days after Edmund’s departure, I simply had to get another fish so Serenity wouldn’t look so damn sad. I got Fawkes from Walmart (surprisingly enough) complete with substantial fin and tail rot on his dorsal only. So I brought him home and treated him for a week before I put him in Edmund’s old bowl. At first, he looked totally depressed and did nothing but lay on the bottom staring into space. Serenity looked on excitedly, most likely thinking he was Edmund. But for a while now, Fawkes has been much more active and has given Serenity substantial attention, although I think she now realizes that Fawkes is NOT Edmund. She still seems interested, and he spends a decent amount of time on that side of the bowl. When I got back from work today, low and behold: Fawkes’s very first bubble nest!!! Several bubbles deep and at an inch or so in diameter.. not bad for a first! Im so happy that I have a happy fish!

1	*cue the dance of triumph*  After several weeks of trainees, being a slave to the LFN muse, false starts, rewrites, huge deleting sprees, more rewrites, I have finally sent Chapter Three of "Sound of a Kiss" to my darling beta-reader.  *hugs darling beta-reader and assures her that there is no rush because, let's face it, I took freaking long enough to write teh damn thing*  Drinks of relief all round!  Woohoo!
0	Why is it so hard to throw away these unhealthy thoughts?  I wanted to look at old pictures of myself when I had short hair because I'm getting a haircut tomorrow. Instead of thinking how cute my hair was all I could think was how skinny I used to be.  Yeah, I know it's natural to be thinner in high school and college than when you are an old married lady, but I used to weigh in at less than 100 pounds.  For me this is underweight. How I got to be this weight was well plain unhealthy, but that never hits me. I always think I want to be that thin again, and I have to force myself to remember being thin and still thinking I was fat. Being thin and being depressed. Being thin and everyone telling me I was too skinny but never seeing it myself.  You can never be thin enough.  I never want to count calories again; it becomes obsessive. I never to want to measure my waist everyday.  I never want to look at myself and wish more bones were visible.  I never want to worry about food again.
1	YAY I start my new job next week! And working normalish days again.. NO MORE GRAVEYARD SHIFTS! *bounce* Well there is my exicting news for the month... Other than that currently working a graveyard shift... joy of all joys. Been an odd few days - With Si's aunt (well technically great aunt) dying and going to the funeral up and Dargaville... always makes you reflect on life or your own mortality.  Went shopping this morning and bought Si a new puter game to cheer him up. Other than that life as normal :o)
0	*bangs head on the wall*  *cries hopelessly*  *sniffs*  So, I *gulps* had my maths exam yesterday.  And.  I.  Totally.  Screwed.  One.  Calculation.  *wails*  I  knew  how to do it, but still, I had to do it wrong! Other nine  calculations I got right, though, but I can't be happy about that when  I. Got. One. Wrong. And will probably get 0 points of it. *starts sobbing* *tries to get a grip of herself*  But no more about that. Tomorrow is my last exam, in French. Prepare yourselves for an extra-long post during the weekend.

0	I've just woken up, and I mean really woken up.  After snakes & ladders at archery I came home and pretty much crashed. And have now woken up. And I mean completely up. But to that exhausted but sleep free place.  And what really sucks is having just got an email from Odeon..... turns out Magic Roundabout isn't showing on Saturday. There goes my start of holiday treat.

0	I wish I didn't see the truth in what is said, that I could close my eyes to the awfulness and just go back to my normal life.  It's really difficult to accept that enforced sterilization was supported by people such as Roosevelt, and that people who supposedly thought that women's place is in the home-- the barefoot and pregnant idea-- also thought that some women didn't have the right to be barefoot and pregnant if they wanted to be, and needed to be sterilized at the ages of something like 13.  How do we PRESUME to have the right to tell people that female circumcision is a violation of women's rights when we ourselves believe that certain women should be the ones having babies and other women should be the ones working in the factories and NOT having babies?  How can we presume. How can we be so ARROGANT.    That's the thing that grates the most, I think.  The ARROGANCE.     And I don't know what to do.

1	It was cool Halloween. I saw a Power Ranger, a white boy Eminem, a Cat in the Hat, like 3 secret agents, and 3 bloody roar characters (alice the bunny, shenlong the tiger, and xion the unborn). Awesomeness. I hung around with Trina and the guys and it was pretty cool. Didn't get to see Chainsaw Masscre on bootleg DVD though. :-( And I helped Trina yesterday. ^_^ And I'm pretty happy today because my history homework got a lot easier (test still hard), and EverWars started a new tournament! Yeah!   P.S. 358!
1	I'm almost back in the living today,  Though they did try and get me to stay up to make sure some code worked, and I guess fix it if it didn't, but I'm not up for staying up til 3 today.  Some other day, no problem, but not tonight.  I said I'd go into work tomorrow instead - I'd planned to take the day off.  Never mind, I'll try to get thurs off so I can sort things out for the weekend - I'm going to visit       flyinghaggis   !  I had a bit of a weak moment today:  Johnny Depp Pirate Poster .  I just  love  the boots and the pose.  And of course, the Depp.  What's not to love about the Depp?!  Andy is too lovely :) He told me to buy it!   P.S.  I need to make myself an icon that represents "Yippee!".  'Cos that's what I'd use now :)
1	NYC tomorrow. If you need to find me I will be at Max Fish or 2A drinking. Friday - meeting with Matador records. GBV Saturday - Irving Plaza.
0	I'm sick! And I'm not talking about sick in the head because...well...you could say that, too, but that's pretty much a 24/7 thing for me, whereas sickness of the sinusii aren't as common. Okay, that's another lie, I get sick all the damn time, but you'll only hear me admit it when it's all sorts of hella serious.  Note to self! Self, never blow nose with scented toilet paper.  Note to self strikes back! Never, no matter how cool you think it will be, attempt to poop, pee, sneeze, and vomit all at the same time.  Not pretty.   Return of note to self! As much as you hate to admit it, spontaneously attempting to grow a vagina  does not work.  Get over it and move on, son. You'll never be a real girl.          Also!   LET IT BE KNOWN!   Tomorrow is going to  suck  hardcore.  
1	Yay! I got a new Tama yesterday! I couldn't believe it, I was walking through the clearance toy section at Wal*Mart and low and behold, there was a Tamagotchi Connection there for $7 bucks! I couldn't believe it! Seven bucks for a Tamagotchi Connection! I wonder why it was on clearance, hmm. It was the only one there too, so everyone check out your local Wal*Mart! But oh well, I got it and I love it! It is my second one! :) I took a picture of it, and my old Tamagotchi Connection that I've had since January.        My old one is the purple one, and the one I got yesterday is the pink one!  The purple one is named Stu and he is a 7th Generation. The pink one is named Noel, and I just started her up a half hour ago! &lt;3  &lt;3 Nickcole
1	Tonight and tomorrow are gonna rock, rock on!  Why you ask?  Well, because Colleen and I are going to keep it real.  Keep it real, you ask?  Yes.  Keep it real by not going to school in protest of some crappy terrorism drill.  Ain't going to go.  Word, man.  Word.  Happy 2 month anniversary, Pat!  I'm only a little nervous now about trying out for section leader.  Today made me SO...less nervous for lack of a better term.  D said I was "very good" at conducting, and Mary said I had the best roll-steps.  I'm still a wee bit nervous about the marching portion of the try-out, but I think Colleen's gonna help me out with that.  So...YAY!!!  WOAH,BUDDIES!  I just realized I have the same computer as Colleen.  Yes, we're SO twins.  Yep, we're going to rock rock on.  But for now, peace peace out.  --Laura
1	Hey guys, I got back from Driver's ed a while ago. First time driving in the "Louf-mobile" or however u spell it. It was so fun! Mr. A. likes to say "woah! big machine!" a lot. I believe I have a new favorite phrase.  A lot of boys smelt amazing today! I loved it. Charlie smelt the best...and Erik. Maybe I just noticed them more cuz their lockers are right next to mine, but man they smell soo good!  Come one guys, read my last entry and give me ways to go about asking a certain guy out!
1	I swear, life gets fucking weirder every day.   I resent the implication that the pass to myself has anything to do with Certain People in attendance at the game.  I mean, come on, if I wanted to do something to get my way onto the team, I'd be unique.  If I tried to copy...a Certain Person, he could very well be like "gee, I can do that, maybe I should be on the team!" and much as I would like to see that, it doesn't help my cause out.    Not that I have a cause.  Because I don't.

Oh, and I got a free rental of Ice Age, because Hollywood video Didn't have it in, like they gaurenteed. So ha... Rain Check it is.  Talking to katie right now, I miss her lots, that I do. *pokes katie* Hi. No, don't think you can poke me back, it's my journal and it's offically against the rules... That's right! so Ha!

Well, off to bed now.                          Happy ThanksGiving...
1	So, finally. Some happiness has happened in my life! This past week and a half have sucked, so this was needed.  1. I got a job! At Adventure Island! $7.00 isn't bad, so I'm pretty happy.  2. Also, I got my first modeling job today! I'm a hair model for Regis Hairstylists! On Monday I'm going to be part of a show, demonstrating a new advanced highlighting routine. So, this is cool.

0	  You're depressed. Really you are. And you definitely have a reason. You often space out and stare at things blankly, even if you're normally hyper and energetic. This is because nothing really seems important anymore. You might just be sad right now, or you might be manic depressive. Don't worry. Have some cocoa and stuff'll be ok.

1	To save myself from saying the same thing over seven times, thank you all for your comments after last entry.  Since then, I have been better; I've been reasonably productive, I've talked to folk, and generally been happy.  I can talk to you all individually, and we can celebrate this fact.  Other good things on the horizon:  1- Trivia 2- Penn Bowl, where I expect Williams A's College Bowl team to do a pretty thorough job of wiping out its competition. 3- With any luck, I'll get to see Katie for a good bit of time while doing Penn Bowl and Trivia.
0	Well, I went to my "big" interview today.  The one for the medical front office position.  Well, needless to say it didn't go too well.  It was a total curtesy interview.  I only got it because of the names I had on my application.  And even, the entire interview was pretty much them telling me politely that I don't qualify.  I mean, they were wasting my time from the start.  They should of done 1 of 2 things...   1) Not schedual me for an interview for no reason.  or   2) be friggin' straight with me.  I hate people who think I'm dumb enough to take pitiful ass excuses as to why they don't want to hire me.  Just tell me point blank, you don't qualify, we dont' want you.  I wasn't even going to argue that I learn extremely quick... it wasn't worth it.    It just sucks that i had my hopes up...
1	church was so nice this morning, and on my way out i ran into my uncle.. which is funny because he goes to a different church than me.. but he took me to my favorite place for lunch maggiano's.. we ate so much food and got to talk about stuff and i'm happy because even though we live together, we don't talk about things very much the way we do when we go out to eat together.  anyway today has been really great so far, and joanna talked to the girl who has my cell phone and i got her number so hopefully before the week is over i will have my phone back woohoo!  it's going to be nice to not have to talk to anybody for a week actually haha.. except for the few really cool people who have my home number.  somebody stole one of my away messages on aim!  haha whatever... ok i'm out.

And good news:      It's $50 cheaper than I thought (I may have misunderstood first sales person, as that's the discount for a router).      Installation is within 20 business days.      So, if all goes well, I'll be setup by July 20th. Which is a couple days after Ozzfest, so I guess I'll be a little adrenaline fiend around then. :-)      Wooohoooo!

LONDON (Reuters) -    "Titantic" star Kate Winslet is to appear in British comedian Ricky Gervais's follow-up to cult sitcom "The Office," The Sun newspaper reported on Saturday.&nbsp;       British actor Jude Law will also star in the sitcom "Extras," which is set in the world of bit-part movie players and sees Gervais playing aging film extra Andy Millman.           "It's great to have Kate Winslet and Jude Law on board as we have so few British people who have made it big in Hollywood, but these are two who have," Gervais told The Sun.           "In 'Extras' Jude and Kate play twisted versions of themselves," Gervais added.    
1	Verbatim from what I just bashed out for   Journey To The REST  , to get the news out as quick as possible! ;^) -- From Minekura-sensei's official site   NITRO   comes the news that the Spring 2005 issue of WARD, ZERO-SUM's quarterly sister publication, will have a  Saiyuki Gaiden  poster and very special announcement about that manga series! With this issue of WARD to be the last for Minekura's  Hachi No Su , anticipation is high that  Gaiden  will take its place in WARD's pages. We'll find out for sure when the Spring 2005 WARD comes out on May 16--almost exactly two years after the last time  Saiyuki Gaiden  saw print, in the July 2003 ZERO SUM that came out May 28, 2003.

1	Well folks, the moment of truth is probably going to be tomorrow, and I've made a preliminary decision, as long as I can get some info from certain people. It's not one that most people who know me would expect, but it's one I think is the right one, considering recent events.  Work today was fine, if a little boring, although I have got some cool stuff from a drug company ;) Mouse mats, torches, books, and a mini voice recorder - COOL ;)  Anyway, updates tomorrow!
1	    Merry Christmas       to all, and to all a goodnight.

1	WHO WANTS TO GO WITH ME TO  DRAGON*CON ?  Atlanta.  Early September.  Please oh please oh puh-leeeeeez?  Jacqueline Carey will be there.  You KNOW I have to go.  Kushiel's Legacy is a work of awesomeness and I'll CRY if I don't get to go.  CRY like a LITTLE GIRL.  While on the phones at work, asking people if they eat frozen french fries.  Jackie: "Do you or anyone in your family eat frozen fries?" Random southern woman: "No, ma'am." Jackie: "GOOD!  THE SURVEY IS OVER!  AND SO IS MY LIFE!  ::bawl::"  Haha, I kid.  Now come with me to the con.
1	Everything's so busy 'round the house now. Momma and Daddy Mark are getting married soon, Santa is coming, Mom-Mom and Pop-Pop are always taking me shopping *beams* I like shopping. It fun! But I like being with Momma and seeing how happy she is. I like it when my Momma is happy!

0	*siiigh*  I guess it's about time I write again ... And as usual I only write when I don't feel too well. Though I don't really know WHY I don't feel good ...  It's just ... I feel like everyone's avoiding me ... I guess I'm just being paranoid but it's just this feeling.  My rooms are almost done (I'm renovating) and my furniture gets here on Tuesday ... I hope everything is ready in two weeks so the party will be okay ...  Well ... this was a bit short but I needed to get it off my mind so ,,,  Mom's yelling I better go

1	Good news, everyone.  I got my job back at the liquor store (I'll be working at Centerville now instead of Fruitville Pike) and my car will be fixed on Saturday.  You know, sometimes good things do happen.
0	i haven't updated in awhile, this week has been interesting. i went to dinner tonuight iwth julie and some friends, it was pretty fun, but i was unusually quiet. last night i was in bed by 11, work totally drained me. thursday, was my brother last night in utah. him and brian left on friday morning. OH MAN i miss the hell out of those kids, but i did get a hug and a kiss fron brian &lt;3 i bought a dress for senior ball also. i don't have a date, but i'm gonna go anyways. why is it that i always seem to develope a HUGE crush on one of my brothers friends?!?!? First there is T.J. he's Zac's friend, and holy hell he's hot, then there is Brian, he's like 27ish, but i still like him. I totally wish school was over, i'm getting bored. i honestly think i'm pathetic cuz i'm going to senior ball stag, Mattie, you better go stag also,  unless you get asked next week, then don't feel obligated to hang out with me. But i'm sick of typing so i'm off. Bonnie
1	Since today looks like it will be a pretty nice day, I believe I will spend it exploring the Penn's Landing area.  I have been told it can be a fun place.  Does anyone have any favorite spots there?  Later if I feel like it, I may do the Independence Mall area...just so I can that while living here, I DID do the tourist thing.

0	I'm seriously so sad by this! You can read about it on Yahoo! News.   Egypt Baby Improving After Extra Head Removed   CAIRO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - An Egyptian baby who underwent a 13-hour operation to remove an extra head will soon be able to breathe on her own, a doctor treating her said on Tuesday.  Ten-month-old Manar Maged was suffering from one of the rarest birth defects -- craniopagus parasiticus -- a problem related to that of conjoined twins linked at the skull.  The head that was removed from Manar in the operation which ended early on Saturday had developed no body, and was capable of smiling and blinking, but not independent life.  The rest of the article and pictures are on yahoo. But it's really grotesque and SAD. The extra head could blink and smile. It was alive. That's incredibly sad.
1	Yea, so.... I never get a chance to actually sit down and write a live journal, but since I'm takin a break from my psychology paper on DID, I decided to do it now. For some reason, life just keeps gettin more and more fast paced, but the weird thing is... i dont care. i dont have time to think, and we all know that thinking gets me into troble. ;). busy w/ work, the play, and of course school is gettin really crazy now... last quart whoop whoop. i cant wait to start plannin the trip to nyc this summer. ummmmm yeah i dont really have much to say for the fact that nothing has really happened since i last wrote in here so ill just get back to my psych project.
0	I think it's ok. she is the linexshoe to my narrator. I will go with her in her journal. I'd follow her anywhere.  i know I"m not half the man/beast/girl she is, but that's fine.
1	Greetings, wolves and friends. I just joined up (thanks to the mods for approving me so speedily), so I guess I'm the new wolf on the block... Name's Cyno, BTW. Hopefully I'll have a pic up soon, although I'm not all that exciting- just your average white wolf.  My journal is brand new, so feel free to add me- I do so love making new friends ^^ I hope to get to know you all in days to come.  Be well!  -Cyno

1	I have never had such a wonderful feeling like this before.
0	Dad was admitted to the hospital today with something called celulosis and a sinus infection. He'll probably be able to come home mid-week next week, but they'll have to do surgery in (about) six weeks to repair the damage to his sinuses so he doesn't develop a brain absess since whateveritis has eaten a hole in his skull. Poor Dad. I'm going to visit him after work tomorrow.

0	I HATE MEN!!! I SWEAR IF ONE MORE GUY LIES TO ME I'LL GO INSANE! GRRRRAAAAHHHHHHHHEE!!! I HATE HOW LIFE LIKES TO LAUGH AT EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY ME! AND IT WAS MARK OF ALL PEOPLE!! HE'S LIED TO ME FOR THE PASS 2 YEARS...AND THEN MEGAN WOKE UP!! i just wish i knew why this always happens to me...it never fails; maybe i will kill myself soon. i see no real reason to stay here, especially alive. and me and anthony make a good pair of friends, his ex keeps leading him on and the only love life i get that i want i can't have. i hope mitch will let me call him...i surely won't be able to talk online all the much tonight. i hate it sooo much, life seems to just get worse and worse. and JD, the new guy i like, keeps trying to help me but it's not working...nothing ever works, and i'm slowly dying. especially the more megan and lorna wake up and i can't hold them back or i'm completely gone when they're awake.

1	The more I think about how I am about to install Doom 3, the more exciting it is :O  I remember downloading Doom off a BBS with my 14.4 modem when I was 12. That took a really long time!  I don't exactly have any special memories of Doom 2 :o BUT THAT'S OK!   I really think Wolfenstein 3-D changed my life :O

1	So, the release is official. Call me nerd. Call me whatever, I don't care.  Apple's newest OS (Tiger) is being released on April 29th. My copy is already pre-ordered. Shweet!
1	I'm coming up april 1st (Friday) and leaving April 3rd. Emails will be sent to the people who better make time to see me or will rot in hell. My only demands are that I get my favorite juice from Campco and that we either go sake bombing or to the frat (or both.) See ya'll soon!
1	I'm such a happy girl, man!  I got to catch Phish jammin on the Letterman show. It was great. Totally entranced with it, I loved it. I love Phish and must say I will miss them being around. I never even got to go to one show. But thats ok, its cool. I rather that than see them get torn apart by something like what happened with another band I love-- Pink Floyd. Oh yeh, I'd never want to see a band I love dearly go down like the Floyd.  So anyway, I'm very happy to have seen them like that at least :)  Off I go for a bite to eat.

0	This feels like one of those days where I don't understand time. All I want to do is sit here immersed in music, and watch my thoughts rush by faster than I can understand them.  This doesn't usually happen when I'm this busy. I hope it isn't a problem.  Life is changing, and it's doing it a lot.
0	Well, I've decided to give myself even more inspiration for finding a job, I'm gonna be cutting down on my internet time untill I do, I'll still check Livejournal and email, an' maybe hop on msn an' such, but mostly i'll be offline till I find a job, 'cause if I don't find one soon we're gonna be in trouble, of the money variety. x_x
1	All Berkeley students...  Vote for:  #85 Liz   (that's me)  in the ASUC Senate election.   Thanks.
1	What a strange night again. I had questions ranging from "What's your LJ username?" by the person you would least expect it; to "How come that you are always happy?" by another weird individual. Plus there were certain "ass-grabbers" in the club and other people who were kissing me on the cheek whenever they passed by. I danced with everyone (a total male slut with the flapping peanut foreskin in the wind). Very happy night indeed. Plus this sunny day seems like it is becoming happy as well - looking forward to working.
1	PARTY TONIGHT..... and the guest of honor is none other than our favorite Cyana Lady...Oh Emm Geee. I havent been this excited for a while now.  The girls are making a homemade cone for the cats head out of duct tape and a paper bag....It is fucking hilarious...And a bit sad...But still funny because we are horrile people..Most of the time.  atkins=sadness in my tummy.  Holy shit I need a nap to prepare myself for tonight...I plan on not sleeping....  EVERYONE COME AND SEE HOW PRETTY WE MADE THIS PLACE YOU WILL LOVE LOVE LOOOOVE IT!  good day!

0	So, last night       mrpet    cleaned the kitchen.  Our cats seemed to think this was a sign of the apocalypse.  Or, at the very least, that we were about to move away and leave them in a shelter.  (This makes some sense, actually, since their previous people probably cleaned up the place before giving them away.)  I keep telling them that we're not moving, and that even if we were, we would take them with us, but unfortunately I do not speak cat, and so, they are not terribly reassured.  I think they're going to get even more anxious when I leave the house today, but there's nothing to be done except give them lots of love.  Poor traumatized kitties.  There is nothing more to fear.
0	i just watched "o". the most depressing film ever. why does shakespeare have to be so tragic? josh hartnett is rather prettyful though, shame he had to be the bad guy.

1	hopefully, if zodi is feeling any better when she wakes up, we will be heading to the river with jay today.  hopefully.  (pleasepleasepleasepleeeeeeeeeease...)  we'll be taking mione too; i hope she likes it.  ^^  i juped on the bandwagon and joined myspace.com, for all those of you who have accounts on there.  i don't feel like looking up my url right now, but you can search foster witchwood and you'll find me.  or, if you are as lazy as i am and don't feel like it, you can ask me and i'll go fetch the url for you.    time to go get zodi up...
0	New years resolution added.  Never -ever- bluff on something that one is not expecting to go through with... ;_;

1	Tonights the HALLOWEEN dance! Holly and I are going to be 80's and then sunday we are going to be Pussycat dolls!!! I still have my fairy costume, maybe I'll wear it out saturday night. I'm so excited to get all 80's.After the dance is the huge Rocky Horror Show and its interactive how FUN!
1	Went to the city with Holly, Aaron and Durrant on Friday. T'was awright indeed.   The beginning of  Easter  Spring break has started quite bitterly for everybody it seems. Not so much me - I spent today watching a programme about Simon Cowell and Bicentennial Man (not one programme about the two together; a programme then the film) before not-getting-promoted on PES4 for the third or fourth time. Tommorow I'm going to see Lewis and on Wednesday myself, Holly, Aaron and Durrant are supposed to be going to Pleasurewood Hills. So it's all good really.  All I can be bothered to write ay tee emm.
0	Got my first phone interview since sending out resumes here. It was about a half hour and I got asked about all sorts of programming stuff. In the end, was told I would probably not be getting called in for the day-long interview, etc. Main reason cited was my not being familiar enough with syntax. Bleah. Foggy on some of the keywords for abstract classes, inheritance, etc, as it got bundled up in my brain with the java versions of same.  It's pretty disappointing to finally get a call only to hear that it won't go any further, but at least it's a start. I'll keep my fingers crossed for a repeat of the opportunity and in the meantime brush up on some of my advanced syntax options.

0	 I am offically depressed today.    I am interesting in nothing but staring at my walls... .... and eating.    I felt it coming on yesterday, but it has been a while since I had a bout this severe.    I want to write but I don't have the energy.    I am not self loathing or angry, but empty.&nbsp; I hold no real feelings today.    I want to sleep it off...     "Do you couples in the moonlight make you cry too?"

1	I went down into my basement last week and what do you think I found?  Yup, water!  A big puddle in the middle of my floor that had obviously come out of the drain in the floor.  Now this drain has always been dry in the year and 4 months that I have been in this house and so I wasn't expecting to have any problems with it.  So much for that.  Luckily, there was no damage to anything.  The floor is concrete and the only things that got wet were the bottoms of plastic storage containers.  Well, I cleaned up that water and decided to keep an eye on it to see if it overflowed again.  Sure enough, water appeared again and so I knew I would have to call a plumber to take a look at it.  Today, the plumber came and took a look and said that it looks like I just need to have the pipe cleaned out.  He was able to do that right away and now it works!  Yeah!  No more puddles!  So I am happy.
0	i've been so depressed the last few weeks.  i need this break like nothing else, even though i know it won't nearly be enough.
0	There is no reason to be cruel.  How would you feel?
1	F##k November.    But, I love life anyway.   I got a package today.  It came from CDBaby.com, an internet resource for musica.  I've been looking for over a year for the two albums of a dead band called Penfold.  Some of you may have heard of them.  A Jersey band, called "math rock" in CDBaby's listings.  I'd probably dump them in the good old "emo" category, but that's probably just me.  They're an awesome band though, I love their music.  I've had recordings of their live sets for as long as I've known about them, but couldn't get ahold of their actual albums.  And now I managed it, and I am uber-happy.  It's so good.  I talked to an old friend today.  I had always felt (probably more assumed, unsubstantially) that there were some elements of dischord between us, and it always bothered me.  Know for sure today that if it had ever been, it's all long since washed away, and that's a great feeling, really.  So, yeah.  I'm happy.
0	Just got the call. Grandpa just passed. My husband is being very strong, not crying yet. Im trying not to. I dont want to upset him. I feel for our whole family. I know this is better, I know he isnt feeling any more pain and he can move and talk and all that. I know he is in heaven and it should make me feel better, god knows thats the advice I give but it doesnt. I wish I had seen him since Christmas. I wish I had gotten to kiss him and tell him I loved him. He was the only one I had called Grandpa in such a long time. I really loved that man. He was the most wonderful man. I dont know what to do, how to help my husband. I know the only thing I can do is be there for him and I am there for him, I hug him ,tell him I love him. I just wish there was more. Some button to push to make the grieving not so hard. The services are going to be scheduled for next week. I'm gonna go lay with my husband and son for awhile...
0	i just almost cried and i don't know why... all i really know is that i'm currently very late and letting people down.. i wonder if i was meant for this place, that place... or love... and where i will find it if i am even supposed to..  -The Fallen
1	Watched MaryKate&Ashley's  The Challenge .  I kid you not.  Derived much fun from laughing at it.  Also watched  Never Been Kissed  with Drew Barrymore.  NBK cute, although for a 25 year old woman, she was  very  immature.  I know the point was for her to be thus, but then to pair her with a person of her age... it broke even my sturdy chick flick shield of belief.

It would suck if he was sick and couldn't enjoy it!! I am so excited I can't wait to leave this snow and when i get back there better not be any snow left either! Well i would love to stay and chat but i gotta go watch SUPERNANNY!!! that is my favorite show it is so good the kids are evil!!

I have to take my exam for m. science tomorrow and thats great except for the fact that I dont have anything to study with. Oh well... I guess I have all week. Maybe I will just go back in on Friday or something.  Dave moves in with Matt at the end of this month. Im not sure how I feel about that.  I guess I will be okay, we dont speak much anymore anyways. okay so now Im suddenly depressed... ugh... Im getting off ;( bye
1	I've been writing like mad for most of the day, because I am going to watch the new  Carrie  that's coming on NBC. I'm looking forward to it like you wouldn't believe.  Carrie  is my favorite Stephen King book. I have popcorn, coffee, and Bailey's Irish Creme whiskey, and I'm ready to veg out. Woohoo!
1	So I was reprimanded for not writing in my LJ more often over the Thanksgiving holiday.  So I figured that I would post a plan for my future as decided by my therapist and I tonight.  Amy and I are going to start a small side-business making chainmail and jewelry.  We'll probably be selling some of it over the internet and then see how things go at the local faires and such.  I'm going to take a few intro to business classes at TJC or UT Tyler.  Then, depending on how things go at RDA, I will probably quit and go to work at a Starbucks or other local coffee shop, with the chainmail side-business helping with the pay-cut.  After some time there I will be opening a late-night coffee shop in Tyler.  Wish me luck!
0	So your probably wandering why I deleted all my journal entries.....well that was the old me and this one is going to be the new me lol (cheesy).....so the reason why it's the new me is that you'll notice there'll will be a big change in me....I probably won't be as happy and excited anymore.....I won't be drinking or partying.......prolly stay to myself a lot.....and thats pretty much it..........don't be alarmed if I break out into tears out of no where
1	Today I did nothing at school, because the building next door was burning!  This pic is for Kirby *BLUSH*   I hope he don't get scared of me.. lol.
1	We returned from Great Falls late last night where we had seen a Perinatologist.  All is well! Jennifer is doing great and the baby (fetus) is very healthy and right on schedule. 12 weeks old, 5.5 cm long, and active.  In fact, on ultrasound we even got to see the heart beating and the mid line of the brain.
1	Check this out!!!!! It's so fucken cool!!!!  Kung Fu Hustle  http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/kung _fu_hustle.html   I am so fuckin there!!!
1	I just went to Best Buy and wasted some money   I purchased these dvds:   Drawing Flies   Jeff Buckley: Live In Chicago  [Hes live at the Metro!]  Pulp Fiction  (special edition)  spent about 55 bucks, I feel better.  Last night I saw three crappy bands, but thats alright. I was in entertaining company.  So my plans for the day is:  About A Boy playing at 7:30 on campus (free) (maybe I'll get popcorn..?) Some free show at the same bar I went to last night (free) Watch my new dvds. Maybe I'll have some company over to view these dvds with me, or I'll just watch them on my own.  Oh yeah, I went to an awesome record store last night, they had subway ads for Radiohead posters. I restrained myself from buying everything. Also I have to find a guitar. Later.
0	The Results of the presdiental election are: Bush wins! Well I really not a Bush supporter. (Of course I wasn't REALLY on Kerry's side either..Politics is just not my thing!) I'm not really looking forward to four more years under Bush....But, hey, I'm only 15...I can't really do anything about it. (Well I guess it is ok, because after 4 more years...Bush will have served 2 terms. (I know that 4 years is going to be a really long time. *Heck though..the last 4 years went by and I hardly realized it...*)    ___The bell is about to ring in like 5 minutes...I've gotta go.____       *SEE YA!~_^*
0	so I know some of you lurkers out there were waiting for this... yeah it's coming: finally a little post on the sadness of presday 2005.  I don't have much to say because there really isn't much to say.  I'm sad, but what can you do... what's done is done, so you can only look at the present and then the future.  Until then, my layout is green as a reminder...  if you don't know what the heck I'm talking about, you should stop lurking my journal and just ask. holla
1	I took a recent photograph, you can find below, of some trees in Manassas... this is what it turned into today...        
0	alrighty kids i won't be online for the next 2 weeks at least cause i'll be at david bowie concert, field school, jmu, the cure concert, or more field school.  so wish me luck and if you need me give my cell a call:)   in the meantime, pray for collin libassi's family. i miss you collin and i hope everything works out.
0	Well, last night Lucky Bunny died.  She was doing so well, but she died in her sleep, and I'll miss her very much.  I've taken care of her most of her life, changed her litter pan, walked her around in the yard, cuddled up to her while I watched TV or did homework, and even fed and watered her, as well as getting her to eat cereal with me every morning, Raisin Bran, my personal favorite.  I always saved her parts of my carrots and bananas because she loved them so much.  We shared raisins, and triscuits and wheat thins together.  And now she's gone, and I'll always miss her.
1	19 days till me birthday...so soon yet nuffin to do, meh :'(
0	This weekend was utterly boring and pointless. I didn't get to go to Cold Warz (gaming-nerd fest at Alerus) because I don't have a computer or any money to go so I was stuck doing absolutely nothing. Now I'm talking to Nikki on messenger and she's telling me how great it is. I want to go so baaaad. ;____;

1	I'm leaving tomorrow at 6am for Florida.  My parents and grandparents are going to the Keys for a few days, so I will have my grandparents' condo in Ft. Myers to myself.  One of my best friends from college, Lisa, is flying down from D.C. to meet me.  We're going to have some relaxing girltime.  I CANNOT WAIT to get out of MN for a few days.  It's so freaking cold and I haven't left town since I went to Colorado in July.  I'm overdue for a vacation!  So... I will back on Monday!  peace.
1	 Ya know why I'm super lucky? because I've got a good looking family. haha    my sibs..the sisters and the brother.&nbsp; :)     &nbsp;      and the next generation of my fmaily...      &nbsp;         &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp; 
1	 PS: FREEDOM WEEKEND KICKED MY ASS.             But it was 100% worth it. 
1	                               and for all you that poo poo this wedding, this is at least a wedding of love...and if you think Diana was a saint you'd be wrong. she actually had affairs before charles ever went back to Camilla. cut the lady some slack.
0	I have so many things on my heart right now. Still dealing with stuff from saturday. Chris I wll talk to you about it but tonight wasn't the time or place. I just need to find some kind of inner strength that I don't have right now.  I just want so badly someone to hold and just express my pain to. I by no means have a horrible life and thankful for my blessings but at the end of the day I feel alone in this world. God all I ask for is for some type of kindred spirit.
1	My best friend, Cryss read that  this website  is giving away free iPods! Apparently some girl that joined said all she had to do was sign up for an online offer.. and after the "trial period" you cancel the offer and bam! you get a free ipod. I don't know about you, but that sounds awesome!   So I've joined up and you should too! Basically all you have to do is that  join  , complete an online offer, and then refer friends to do the same. That's it! I signed up to try out some dietary supplements & Cryss signed up for that blockbuster version of netflix... (and so far she loves it)... but you don't have to sign up for the same things we signed up for... there's a list of other diferent things you can sign up for...   Anyway click on the link to sign up! Lets get free iPods:  http://www.freeiPods.com/?r=1341002 1   Thanks in advance, Post a comment and let me know what you signed up for! :D
1	People are so nice. Today I tried to cutthe grass and the lawnmower didn't start (my fault b/c i didn't put gass in it from last time),butone ofmy neighbors,TJ, that i haven't talked to since 5th grade offeredme his lawn mower. i thought that wasnice as hell.  Too badI burnt my hand on the motor ori'd be cutting my grass. Also, yeasterday onn my break from work i lockedmykeys in my car, i called the house my mpm's cellphone and my brother's but the only person who could help me out wasLaura.  She drove overto my house ,got the spare keys from my sisterand gave them to me at the gas station. I'm lucky to have such a goodbest friend.
1	1. It's annoying when someone excludes you from confidences you used to be entitled to. 2. It's even more annoying when someone cuts short every discussion when you have the temerity to express an opinion. 3. When a woman says she needs to lose a few pounds before buying a swimsuit - even if you don't agree -  what the hell are you supposed to say?   All that said, I actually had a quite tolerable trip up to Phoenix and back this morning, and I'm more excited by the moment about the Tori concert tonight. Yay! Tori! and Ben Folds! and Tori! #drool# *wipes off drool* okay, time to go get dressed...
1	Tomorrow is the big Michigan-Michigan State game.  Blue v Green. Spartans  taking on the much honored Blue and Gold. This year instead of the usual   invasion of my home I am taking the party a local watering hole.  I am really looking forward to actually seeing the game and enjoying a   tasty beverage or 6.  GO BLUE !!!!!!!!!!!!
1	.... dramatic pause..........           CHRIS GOT ME A SIGNED COPY OF  JOHNNY THE HOMICIDAL MANIAC  number 1!!!!!!!! SIGNED BY HIM THE ARTIST!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO -Jay
0	I think I had a dream about going back to uni.  Suffice to say it was really disappointing to wake up.
0	Am at work and feeling rather depressed today for a few small (and should really be insignificant) reasons.  Not looking forward to staying at home tonight, everybody's gonna be away as well!
1	At last, been a killer of a week after spending last weekend in Maths Camp, so exorsted! Oh well 2 weeks to ummmmmmmmmm work on finsishing of my CertEd. Off to Bedford on Monday for boring 3 day resdential, slumming it in halls (nice 60's style with pealing pain and old fashion baths ext....)  Went to beer festival yesterday, not bad, Quinnie had one to many and was v poorly, bless him. Want to party tonight! Need to see what peeps are up to. Tryed to get onto DMU's VLE, plie of shite couldn't get on. It been a total waste of time. Signed up for doing my Level 4 Numeracy Speicalist yesterday, did OK in test but forgot how to do bastard equations. Need to do some revision between now and september. May also look into doing Key Stage 2/3 qual so I can teach in school too, one must always keep ones options open.  Guess may make updating journal next week, miricles do happen?!?!?!?!?
1	Since this is my last evening at home before the Christmas holiday, I think it’s time to wish you all a very, very…   Merry Christmas And A happy new year!!!!   Take care you all and I’ll see you after new years.  *lots of hugs* :)
1	Oh my gosh! Crew has decided to start working out at the fitness center at 7:30 at night!! AT NIGHT!!! It might have to do with the fact that four days out of this week we are going to the boat house, which means getting up at four in the morning, but we are going in groups, so not everybody has to go. I am so excited! I can go to IHOP!!   Funny thots:  No! Don’t touch tha...ok, now the mooses are going to take over the world.   My singing has been compared to the death throes of a moose.   Serious thot:  A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.  The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit  Proverbs 15:1,4
0	I've finally moved all of my belongings into my new flat. Boxes are everywhere. I never realised I had this much stuff in that one flat in Dublin. The furniture was the hardest part of it all. I got one of the blokes on the team to help me bring that into the flat, but I still haven't unpacked the boxes yet.  Searlait said that she would help me settle in and unpack but when I rang her the other night, her mum said that Searlait was on holiday. I didn't realise until then just how much I have been counting on her to help me adjust to this new city. I only know a handful of people. The blokes on the team have their own lives and I don't know them all that well. Well enough to ask for help with heavy lifting, but not well enough to have a drink at a pub with them.  I'm starting to get sort of lonely here. My family is farther than they've ever been and the person I made this move for left on holiday without even telling me. Maybe this move was a mistake.

1	 Bushgame   There is something very, very right about Hulk Hogan, He-Man, and Mister T teaming up to fight enemies like The Staypuft Man, Janet Jackson's Robonipple, Hilary Duff, Darth Rumsfeld, Voltron, and even Mutant Bush himself.

0	Man I fought horribly with my mother again today. This time im a failure of a son due to my inability to take out the recycling bin, which extends to my inability to do anything right. So there it is... Man I am sorry if I'm being all whiney and teenagerish...I'll stop. Is anyone alive out there?
1	As it turns out, my roomates are throwing their own party at my birthday party tomorrow. WTF how are we going to accommodate that many people? We could pack some of them in the laundry room I guess.
1	Yeah! Good day! I'm in a much more happier mood today and I don't know why.  Maybe it's da prozac o_o;  Nah..n.n;;  I made a new friend today at school whos into Anime like Mindy and I are..he's something not on Toonami! I almost choked on my soda when I found that out..It was a a rare find indeed. Uh..classes..yeah..maybe I should talk about those..maybe not. Well I found out I didn't post this update so anything past this line is for today.   School went well! Nothing really amazing other then classes seem to be comming together for me.  I also almost got hit by a car while I was driving home today from school..Nothing happened though ^_^
1	i actually have a car.... its now in the car park and i just parked it. oh how cool.   Though i am never driving a new car in the dark ever again.
0	I think both of my best friends have left me for guys. That really hurts 2. Heather hardly talks to me at all when she does its nothing very importent. Kayla well we all know that story. I feel really alone. which should be nothing new to me at all by now. I already cried today, but i want to again.Makes you feel a lil better but its making me look even more craby then i already do. Once again i have nothing to do this weekend. I was going to call Heather but shes prob doing somthing with Heath. And who would want me around to mess it all up 4 them?? I want to go home soo bad.
1	Dispite the fact that I didn't get my phone call until nearly 6 o'clock, when I'd already had a shower and my first cup of coffee, I am delighted that we get the day off.  I really needed a break.  I'm a little irritated to be set back a day in my lesson plans, but for my sanity, I really needed the day off.  So now that I'm wide awake, and it's 6:30 in the morning, what am I going to do with my day?  Hmm, reading for school, and maybe some writing for fun.  And I just might take a nap today.  Woot!  I was hoping for a snow day, but didn't think the chances were very good.  The town where my school is wouldn't cancel if the apocolypse occured, and our administrator has been gaining a similar reputation.  I'm thankful that she cancelled today.
1	Guess what I got on my Cognitive Processes paper!??!?!!?  A 97!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't BELIEVE it!  That is just insane.  If for whatever reason I get an A in her class I will simply DIE.  I'm expecting a B, but if I got an A I would be so crazy...  I also got an A in my Personality Theory and Research class (the class I didn't go to a lot).  I've got to head out to ONE more final and then I'll know what's up.  I'm hoping for an A, but this guy is tricky!  Eeeeee!  Wish me luck!!!!

1	Ok so...  Michael  sent me 4 CD's with new songs, and damn... THEY ARE FUCKING AWESOME! I am going to be so addicted from now until they are so overly played I don't realize they are on, lol! I am happy... He's such a freakin' sweet heart and he is so talented, damn I'm loving this new stuff. One song "Undercover Baller" is so totally 'him'. It's about a singer who meets girls and they don't believe he is a celebrity because he doesn't drive flashy cars n' shit. I really like it! I really like 'em all. They aren't all cheesy like his first album either. Some of them are a little, um? Odd. But some of them are just Da Bomb! (&lt;- Haven't said that in a long time hehe) Ok, just had to write and say how excited I am!!! Gonna go enjoy my new CD's!!! *YEAH*
0	I dont know, as the title suggests Im over at the Smithyman's. Sigh, I cant help but feel left out of a lot of things that are going on, I know next to nothing about whats happening with my best friends bday party and I feel like a total idiot. I dont feel like one becuase Im feeling left out, but because I should've done something today that I stupidly didnt. I am weak.
1	   So hmmm, :-D         Sam and I are back together,&nbsp; our shoes match, and I wouldn't have it any other way.         Someone said Macbeth a week before our performance, and the leed got apendicidus, and you say don't be supersticious, but it all worked out in the end, and was mad awsome. I was the FBI agent, and i looked hott.           Chuck Palahniuk is the most amazing writer in the world, but you won't find any of his books in your school library, He wrote Fight Club, before it was a movie.  Read Guts, but make sure you sit down, and you'll never eat carrots the same way again, i promise   .    
1	Or so, until I'm on my way to Disney. I can't wait, I'm going to take as many picures as I can and hope for some good ones.  Also for anyone who's curious, here's our schedule:  Wednesday - Universal Studios Islands of Adventure Thursday - Animal Kingdom, then Magic Kingdom Friday - Blizzard Beach, then Downtown Disney Saturday - MGM and Fantasmic that night Sunday - EPCOT
0	You read it here first, probably the only place you'll read it. Clay and I have broken up. It sucks, but its for the best. We didn't really have anything in common, plus I completely rushed into the relationship after Josh and I broke up. I think that I was looking for someone to fill the void and that wasn't fair on my part. Just thought you all should know.  Xander

0	Ah, nothing like watching Pilot's to American Sitcoms and Five is getting good at it. Tonight was the first episode of "Two and a Half Men" with  Charlie Sheen  and  jon Crye  r  (both from  Hot Shots  :o). Pretty good in my opinion!
1	Right well i have the computer til friday!  Anyway. Its snowing.  I want to go out and play in it! Also been listening to a lot of Moby just now.  I like him.  Pauline xx
0	Great, I was thinking about life the today. Stupid boredom! I hate thinking about life. I start to notice how empty and boring mine is and how rich and exciting (even if it sucks) everyone else's is. I don't have a hobby, no clue what I enjoy doing so I can choose a career, nothing. Sometimes I wonder what's the point in living when there is nothing to live for. Stupid boredem!!!!!! I need something to preoccupy my mind now. -_-  On a lighter note, I think I might finally be getting a job. Though I'm sure the other guy will be hired for it anyway. Meh, I'm depressed now...
0	Yea, i tohught the last entry was too explicit.  Same feeling thougth.  I just get dissapointed sometimes and i don't understand some people's actions.  But it's all good because there else nothing else i can do then what I am doing.    On a lighter note, Derek johnson is my hot friend who has changed his live journal to  http://www.livejournal.com/users/trekki e747/  Check here everyday because there is gonna be some hot action on there!  And by hot action i mean hot action.   And by live journal, i mean, this web site were you can post your thoughts online.  And by online, i mean this thingy called the interenet.  Ok, i will stop now, thanks for your time you giggle sticks.
1	Today was great.  I had classes, I was late, so things started out bad.  But then things got better.  The weather cleared up, my car was warm, I filled my tank, got a car wash.  Then I went home, setup my new Pelican Component Selector Pro, splitting RCA cables and such so that everything is hooked up to my liking.  And then things got even better.  After Josh and James came over, I talked to this girl from myspace, her name is Kara Marie.  She is really cute, she has beautiful eyes, and she's into a lot of the same things as me.  I talked to her for several hours, and now, I'm just in a really good mood.  Quote of the Day:   Bender:  Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?   Upgrader:  No, get out.

0	Last night my mom told me that some close family friends were in a car accident on Monday coming back from Reno. There breaks failed and they ended up falling 60 feet into a creek. Two of the young children are moderately hurt, and the my aunt and her daughter are going through surgery becaues they hurt their spinal cords. At this point doctors think they may be paralized. Its just so sad, she just got married a few years ago and her life was just starting. Man, I have no idea what to say or do right now. I just feel like crying, but I can't..life just throws you curve balls and you just dont know what to do when that happens.. Everytime something happens like that it just makes you realize that you should try to live life to its fullest, cuz you never know whats going to happen tomorrow....
1	I'm just feeling really happy today and i don't know (or care) why! :P

0	I bought the  Bombay Dreams  soundtrack. I am a bit disappointed. I love some of the music... maybe a quarter of the CD. The rest leaves me cold. The lyrics are horrible when they're in English, although since I can't understand any of the Indian languages, I have no idea if the lyrics are actually that insipid when they're in Hindi or Tamil or what have you. I've heard that a lot of the music changed between the UK production (which this CD is) and the Broadway production. I will listen to the US production, should they release a CD of that.  I hope it's better than the UK music.  There are just too many sicky pop ballads in the musical, and they sound like musical theater pop ballads (or Disney Pop Ballads) and not good old Bollywood music. I'll put some mp3 samples up for the curious. Probably later today.
1	I just came from a potluck at Sarra's house. I contributed chocolate pudding cake. All the food was yummy.  Also, I hula-hooped. And we played a game of Questions, which is my all-time favourite game, practically, in the entire world. Hip hip!!  A very good Saturday evening for me. Horray!!!!!!!  THANK-YOU (AGAIN), SARRA, FOR HAVING ME OVER AT YOUR HOUSE!
1	Because I could not remember the name of a cemetery in Queens, NY that I want to visit I through in "cemetery queens" into the search at Amazon since I know there is a book about the cemetery of interest. I didn't get to the cemetery I'm interested in because  this  is the first book that came up.  Now, the question is, do I wait for my mother or some beloved family member to buy it for me, or do I order it when I order Rotersand's and Icon of Coil's new ones tomorrow?  Off to the dentist...  Oh yeah, I looked at the slides of my back biopsy this AM. Not much there a little melanocytic hyperplasia but no nests really, so so far it can't even be called a nevus (mole). Deeper cuts have been ordered. So, we'll see what turns up. And there's is only a little bit o' sun damage which is good considering I was a lifeguard for 5 years. Yeah sunscreen!
1	The New Pornographers  I think I have to go to see this band. They're playing at the Bowery Ballroom, Monday, August 25th.   They have SUCH a late 1970s intense new wave sound. I miss that bands don't sound like this anymore. I love pop-ish songs that give you chills and make you feel like getting high on the railroad tracks or going to a drive-in movie.

1	Today was pretty cool.  Still haven't gotten to see Scott for a while.  :-(  I'll possibly get to see him tomorrow.  I went to Comedy Caravan with Ken, Kender and one of Fab's residents, Gordo.  It was fun.  We went to play pool for a while afterward, and Gordo learned that I suck at that game.  But ummmmmm, yeah.  Pool was never my game.  I told him that I'd kick his ass at bowling sometime though.  I'm not sure if I can, but I'll try.  I am definitely better at that than pool at least.  We told Gordo that he's gotta hang out with us more often and come to dinner and stuff.  I hope he does... it'll double the number of straight men in the Circle.  &gt;_&lt;  Ken lost Luthien's CD somewhere in my car... I dunno how he manged it but he did.  I so need to find that, cuz I really like that CD.  Anyhow, I'm heading to bed.  Night all! Gryff
0	I've NEVER professed to be perfect.  When I make a mistake, I try to make amends.  Most of the time, I'm successful.  Occasionally, I'm not.  A few days ago, I lost a friend that I've had for almost 15 years because of my misuse of words.  I attempted to apologize.  I was not successful.  Words can cause incredible pain and heartache.  Who should know this better than me, after years of negativity thrown my way from an early age, from both family and classmates?  Goodbye, my friend.  I hope you'll find peace

1	 Finding Jean  was  remixed ! The remix is from Logan's POV instead of Scott's, which I thought was interesting. The slash was taken out. On one hand, that makes me a little sad, since it would be nice to see from Logan's POV, but on the other, it's awesome because I like gen a lot. I'm pretty sure I know who remixed my story. 'Cause I'm smart like that.  I'm somewhat irritated* about my story being posted without the note I put when I sent it in. It was a rather important note, and now I'm scared no one will understand the story. Sigh. But, the moderator was probably just c/ping everything into a format and not worried about it, being as she was very busy. I'm not too distraught. I just hope everybody doesn't HATE IT because it makes no sense until you realize something. (Yes, I'm being vague because stories are still annonymous.)  * Not really, because it was just a misunderstanding on my part. 
1	Yesterday I walked from quasi-ballard (starting nearby the QFC on Holman Road) all the way back to my house (this was about 40 to 45 blocks all told).  this is the longest walk I've been on in a long ass time, but it was surprisingly easy to do.  I should do that more often, but it's so hard to get myself in a situation where it's the best option.  Basically what I have to do is be somewhere without a car and then convince myself that the bus isn't a better option.  Also, the other day my dad gave me a B12 supplement spray.  One sprays it under one's tongue, holds it for thirty seconds, swallows, and is suddenly healthier or something.  It's rather bizarre, but I'm goin' with it because who couldn't use more vitamins?  Certainly not I.  A week from right now, I will be on a plizzane.  Additional:  DUDE!  I PASSED ALL MY CLASSES!  2.58 gpa for the quarter, which is pretty lame, but I passed them all, and that's what matters.  My overall gpa is now 3.3.  Gooooooo me.
1	One of my last entries in this journal. ^__^ I have a new username (elluithauren), and I'll be posting there from now on. o.O It looks very icky at the moment, but I'm waiting for Liz to help me with that. :D   I believe I've friended everyone- now all I have to do is leave and rejoin the communities I'm in. Whee.   ~Libby
0	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today was fucking  relentless.&nbsp; Luckily I can simmer down today... and tomorrow for  that matter, considering I only have two classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel decidedly unloved today.&nbsp; I guess it happens every once in a while.&nbsp;     
0	I woke up on the wrong side of the Pottery Barn Charleston sofa today.  Tell me a story to cheer me up while I'm at class.
1	well i lasted the hole school week without pepsi. facing many hard slightly painfull headacks and much more sleep. i have finnaly decided to jump back into the pepsi...so now the headacks are gone after drinking about 5 pepsi's  last night was a good night, first off the Royals beat DP woot, go football after going to in n' out for a little bit i went home on my bike. when i finnaly got home and entered my house i realized how cold my legs really were and my hands were purple. so i decided to crall into a ball on my couch with a nice blanket and watch some tv. i wake up then next morning stiving for the pepsi...feeling much warmer.  all in all i had a good time last night and i hope everyone else did too.  one more question, what are YOU doing for Halloween?(you as in everyone who reads this)
1	i just wanna dance with david alan grier. not pam grier though. fuck her.   i want to smell roses in the morning. i should just focus on waking up in the morning.  i love the world, even if the world doesn't love me.  ahhhh the smell of happiness.  for the first time in a long while, i'm happy to see my mother tonight. it's been a while, and i'm looking forward to our dinner date.

1	Saturdayness.  Adam and I spent a very pleasant morning running errands after a yummy breakfast and fresh juice (apple, orange and carrot... we got a juice extractor for Christmas).  Now we're watching the Seahawks vs. Rams game.  Not like it matters in the grand scheme of life, but GO SEAHAWKS!  It's been 20 years since they've won a playoff game.  Off to go be vegetative.  Happy weekend!
1	Mommy is good to snuggle, but Mommy AND Daddy are EXTRA warm!  Last night I got to squeeze in between them, and they didn't mind because I went "purr, purr, purr" all night.  Mommy didn't even toss me out of the bedroom for scratching.  Course I didn't scratch last night, because I was so WARM and COMFY!  I'm the *happyest* kitten!
1	Look! Look! This is so awesome. So totally do-able...  http://www.housealive.org/slideshow.h tm 
1	So...which car are we taking and what time should I arrive at chez C?  'Cause if you don't tell me otherwise, I'm planning on 6:30-7:00 AM.
0	Sigh.  My mom just sent me her will for review and approval.  :(  That makes me terribly sad.  I know it's important, but it's still not something I really want to think about.  Can't really even talk about it.  TEOR and Finding Neverland came out yesterday, and I've now watched both of them twice since then.  To quote some article I read at some point, Colin Firth and Johnny Depp are the four sexiest words in the English language (or, hey, any language really).    Yes.  Must think of Colin and Johnny, and not Mom's will.  Just hope I don't have sad dreams.  :(
0	today was awesome, hung out with bobby in town, chilled out in starbucks and had one of the best coversations i think i have ever had. tonight wasnt too good. ima get sacked if i dont fill this stupid folder in for wickes tommorow. grrrrrrr. ima get sacked. damn wickes. damn all the wickes. just updated on my private journal. was reading back over the past year. made me realise how much of a loser i actually am.  =(     
0	  Is it possible for me to feel so happy offline, and then feel strangely off when I come online?  
1	   I had another interview yesterday. It really went well. However I’m trying           To reserve my excitement because I’ve been here before thinking I’ve gotten          It all sewed up and then slammed back to reality.           &nbsp;* holding breath *        &nbsp;     
0	kegan never called...maybe second chances are for hopless people
1	I love Fridays. Especially the day before a Hogsmeade day. They have such a delicious feeling of anticipation. I really enjoy spending time with my friends and just drinking Butterbeers and having fun. It's so... peaceful.
0	This is a very sad bit of  local news .    I saw it on the local news, and thought it was sad, but then I heard that the man that died was a friend of my friend Lorna's son Mark.  Suddenly it's a who lot more personal.  :(
1	eck, chris, and myself are going to  see sin city at 415 at amc newport on the levee. if anyone would like  to join us, meet us in front of the  ticket booth at 400.  more later.
1	christmas is almost here!!!!!!! and i'm making decent money at work!!! AND ahmet is coming after all!!!!!!!! yay!!!! this makes me very very happy
0	via  Fleshbot :  Did you know that "pornography is more addictive than alcohol, cigarettes or illicit drugs?" Or that "one in five children ages 10 to 17 has received sexual solicitations while on the Internet" - and that, by extension, pornography per se is equivalent to pedophilia? Or that "over 80% of Americans are in favor of clamping down on Internet Pornography?" Neither did we. Nor can we find any sources to back up most of the claims made by an alliance of "several U.S. and Canadian organizations" that  announced  a "War on Pornography" campaign in Utah yesterday.    Fleshbot goes on to entreat readers to googlebomb the phrase "War on Pornography" since it would be pretty damn funny if Fleshbot was the first link response.

0	I thought I would be quite indifferent about the death of the Pope since I don't practice Catholicism anymore.&nbsp; Who knew it would make me sad.&nbsp; I guess the church had more impact upon the person I am more than I thought.

1	So I left Gainesville today in the middle of what seemed like a monsoon, only to come down here to more rain and gray skies...fabulous.  I hope it's sunny tomorrow cause I want to go to the beach.  Anyways, I am home and don't know what to do with myself.  The siblings are both working.  Friends are all working too.  I got home, went to Ruby Tuesday's with my mom and step-dad, then to Blockbuster with them to rent a movie that I most likely won't hang around to watch...unless I find nothing else to do.  I am bored already though...stupid rain.  I am gonna go find my laptop and introduce my step-dad to some Dane Cook I think. Later

1	I am ADDICTED to A Perfect Circle.  SUCH a pretty band.  Liberal, and an incredibly wide range of sounds.  And the imagery!  ooo!  I was introduced via       ffx_chorus   's choice this week to "The Noose" ( post is here and lyrics ) and I went, "oooo!" to the lyrics.  I wasn't, at first, impressed by the song, but it's grown on me.  It's just....puuurty!  Also am fond of "Hollow" and "Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums."  The latter is NIN-sounding, and the former is a bit more hard rock-sounding.  My only complaint is this....the lyrics are SO pretty.  Sing them so that we can understand them! ^_^;;  Woah, hello pretty spider on my wall...  Now to brush hair and attempt sleep...g'niiight.
1	At the moment can't really be bothered to write a detailed update, simply because I'm about to go out, but here's the basic factors in my life at the moment:  - I broke it up with Tania two weeks ago  - Been in the algarve for two weeks with much sun and women :cool:  - Have come back to Porto earlier than my parents so I can spend time with my friends  - Am leaving for Luton and Vauxhall on Saturday (mixed feelings)  - Have got a strange suntan which is half faded in some places thanks to "exfoliation"  - Am currently mediocrely rich! I hope all is well with everyone in England, I enjoyed the many comedy texts after that one football match :P  The people at Vauxhall prohibited me from talking about the match when I went over for Open Day. See you all soon!
1	So much has happened. SO MUCH.   I LOVE SEMBREAK!!!!!! i love going to school when there's no class. :D does that make sense? I've been going to Ateneo every weekday for softball practice. It's lovely going there since i know that i'm not really going to be doing anything. I love practicing with the team. yay! .... I love softball. I love the team. I think. not sure yet.   HAPPY B-DAY TANYA!!!! i'm so sorry if i wasn't much fun in your party. oh well.   Do you know those times when everything seems to be going your way? Well, that's how everything is right now. I'm... well... happy with how things are right now. But i am afraid cause nothing lasts forever. i'm fine and happy right now but what about next week? Will I still be happy and shit? The damn karma wheel thing. Damn idiotic little me.
1	Hey, so somebody else implemented my idea first:  Not Yo Grandmama's Knitting Club . I'm so excited there's finally a knitting/crocheting group on campus.  It's at the Fireside Lounge at 8 next Tuesday, so I expect to see all of you there! ;D
0	today sucks.  i am still working on this shitty paper.  i am sick of school, sick of the people, sick of my boyfriend...he still is acting like he's five.  even after our fight he is so disrespectful.  it's really bothering me and i am sick of him.  really sick of him.  i am feeling more and more like i need a cigarette...

0	I think I've been home maybe the total of 2 or 3 hours today. I've been running around all day.   Went to see an old friend for lunch. Stopped by the dollar store to get some mesh laundry bags and some other stuff. I came home and slept for an hour, if you want to call it that. Picked up Tatem at 3. I dont remember what I did between 3 and 5, but I know I left again around 6:30 to have dinner with Jen. &lt;3 Got back home at 8:30.   Just finished watching  The Notebook  and bawled my eyes out. I'm about to start my period and I've been OVERLY emotional. Why can't my life be like the movies? Find love, lose love, go back to love and live happily ever after. Seriously. I want that so bad it hurts. Just something you can't get rid of even if you try and try again. I need to shut down and I will.   Now I'm about to watch  Closer  and probably cry more. I could watch  The Exorcist  right now and bawl. Seriously.
1	there's nothing like spending the night with someone and waking up to realize that there's no doubt in your mind that you want to be with them as many hours of the day as you can manage. unexpected surprises.
1	Today I took my sexy car to the mall and bought clothes and soap. I dont think I want to work in that hell hole again. Pat asked me if I wanted to go on a double date with Tara and Mike. I think that would be good, wholesome fun. Unless, if Tara and I made fun of their oi-ness, which we probably would. I was so mean to Mike at the Toasters show, but it was all in good taste..well..haha. I think tomorrow after school, I'll go to the tattoo shop.
1	    Yeah we bought 5 little fiddler crabs that live inside of a tank in Norm's house!  See Norm's entry about it  here  with more pictures.   P.S.  Just so you guys know... saying "Natalie has crabs!!!" is EXTREMELY HILARIOUS.  Note that this joke will also be hilarious after hearing it TEN MILLION TIMES. :|

0	I always thought I would make a great girlfriend. I think I was wrong.
1	I had a long day yesterday. I went shopping and had a panic attack again. It was near the end. I thought I would be fine, but I guess it just built up.  I ate under 1000 cals today. Not great but not bad.  And for the important news. We got a cat today! She's a four year old calico, shorthaired. She is pretty and very nice. I now have a companion for when my husband leaves for work at night. She's very playful and curious. I haven't named her yet, but I'm thinking about it. We adopted her from the humane society. She was there since August. She also didn't like being with the other cats. The people there let her stay in the office areas. She's not mean though. We can only afford one cat, so it's good she didn't like the other cats. Well, that's all for now. Must work on some homework.
1	I'm going to Florida tomorrow! I'm so excited! I just wanted to do a little virtual dance here before leaving so that everyone would know and so I could say bye. So I'll be back on Tuesday, bitchez. MWA!
1	  i think matt and i are gonna make a guest appearance tanight at the musical but i'm not really sure. it would be kinda cool, i guess. he can freak out all the drama kids. as long as i'm not piano bitch for the 3rd night in a row, i'm happy.      saturday i'll be out most of the day and then sid is coming over for the night. shes gonna come ta the last show on sunday afternoon and then get picked up afterwards. yay. i think shes gonna bring over silent hill and we can play games all night. i havent seen her since teh con so it should be fun. our plans wont get fucked up this time.

0	College is lonely. I really could use some friends.
0	Let's go back to being stoic.  To repression.  To cynicism.  To independence.  To avoiding false comfort.  To stopping thoughts of long departed love.  To nothing.    Shall we?

1	*waves New Zealand flag*  Go Hamish Carter and Brendan Docherty!  Ah. The Olympics bring out my dormant patriotism. Plus its an excuse to blob in front of the telly.  Oooh more snow is promised! *bounce* I am so over the wind and rain and cold. But will put up with more cold for some more snow. Sho purdy.  I have started on making coffees. I got to make my own mocha today! So next time you are in Raen I may be able to make your mocha. ^_^ I am only allowed on with supervision though.  *yawn* Am really tired now. My eyes were all blurry today even with my contacts in so I spent all day squinting and concentrating on trying to see the till and the coffee orders on little yellow post it notes.   Nope. I'm all perked up. The synchronised swimming is on. Gotta go watch that.

0	This entry will be short, as, really, there's far too much to be done to go out and pass judgement upon you peasants this day.  Suffice to say anyone caught stepping out of line will receive no worse than 50-100% of their riches being accosted by me.  Maybe some time on the rack, too.   Go to, then. Big Emperor is watching you.
0	ThAt WaS sO aWeSoMe!!! Yesterday at midnight, I got home from a week in Mexico! That was so much fun... I have a ton of pictures and videos and audio clips and stuff I brought home. It was amazing... I feel like a different person every time I wake up, every time I say something, and every time I look in the mirror. I got a mild sunburn, but I turned bright red. Was that predictable or what? I have the what-sa-ma-callit, uh, Type 1 skin.   Anyway, I brought stuff back, and you may see it on Monday.  Love all, /laugh er

0	My heart says:  Goodbye to personal freedoms Goodbye to any kind of economic recovery Goodbye to well-educated children Goodbye to any international friends for America  But my head says that I can't give up the good fight. I must hold President Bush responsible for his initial pledge 4 years ago to be a uniter, and not a divider. I must force him to reconcile himself with the 49% of the nation who did not vote for him. I must continue to participate in the process, both locally and nationally. And in 4 more years, we will do this again, and hopefully achieve a different outcome.  I'm just hoping that none of those Supreme Court Justices retire or die.
0	Hey Montana take your daughter back, From the bathrooms of Angeles Vall. She believes in destiny Her names always mispelled Waitressing to pay the rent Drinks to quell the smell Of people breathing way too close Folks who don't mean well No one sees the color of your eyes No one sees you smile No one knows the secrets that you hide No one sees you cry She parks her car two blocks away, from apartment 15A She walks with somber in her step and scores along the way Blue's your hue you tiny thing Dropping patrons wine Singing to you own sad song Two feet stuck in the mire Hey Montana take your daughter back It's clear she needs your care These bustling streets are icy veins of a beast who snuffs her prayer Her bones and the truth show through
1	I'm in a good mood today.  :-D  Its bright and sunny out.  Its warm enough to open up the windows in the apartment.  The construction on our roof is pretty much done.  I'm just generally happy.  Life is good right now.    That's all.  Just felt like sharing.  :-)
1	Finally got a copy. Had to trade the not-so-great Final Fantasy Legend (better than Mystic Quest anyway) and $16 bucks for it over on  www.tradegamesnow.com  but it was a good deal. The only time I've seen it was a couple of Pre-Owned copies at EB for $35, but I'm not too enthusiastic about buying used CD/DVD games (carts are fine) from them, cause I got a fucked copy of Final Fantasy 9 (by the time I got to the part where it'sd mess up it was too late to return it, and they wouldn't trade it back -_- so I had to buy another copy) and Chrono Cross (but when I took it back, I got the last copy of Suikoden 3 ^_^) THEY COULD CHECK MORE THOUROUGHLY! XO  *ahem*  So anyway to stop myself from ranting, this is a like new copy and I got it cheaper. :p  Also, traded my old Xenogears guide for a copy of Galerians for       aoshi   's B-Day, so that was a good deal too.  Now I just need to get another copy of FF3 for my SNES and a DC copy pf Grandia 2. :D
0	Lately my crushes have been getting worse and worse.  This last one was just... unbelievable.. I really had strong feelings for him.. I REALLY like him ALOT. God DAMMIT!

1	Thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday yesterday, whether in your own journal or in comments in my journal :-)  I was so feelin' the love with the LJ posts and comments and the e-mails from family members and phone calls from family and friends and just MMMMm Happiness :-)  My friends rock :-)

1	   Halifax, capital of Nova Scotia, lies on a peninsula and is one of the world's largest deep water harbours. This hilly city rises from the harbour and the historic central district to the upper ramparts of the      Halifax     Citadel, a star-shaped fortress, offering visitors splendid views of the city and waterfront. While in     Halifax     be sure to take in the     Maritime       Museum     of the    Atlantic    and Pier 21 - a national historic site that proudly showcases     Canada    's immigrant heritage. A drive to nearby Peggy's Cove, to see what must be the world's most photographed lighthouse is also a 'must-do.'                                        well a weight is gone. kind of nice.      why are you allowed to make me feel bad about my decisions?      i am  excited  !  social division woo        320-330        follower?          &nbsp;            cryptic                 
1	I made a new icon to celebrate getting Kings of Leon tickets for when they play Manchester in June. Yay!! I was worried for a moment because nobody else seems to like them except me but then I saw that one date had already sold out so, slight panic. But I'm going, so joyfulness! I decided to make it an early birthday pressie to Simon - plus, I know he'll be polite and pretend he's having a good time, even if he hates them. At present he doesn't know who they are (he said, "What? The Lion King?"). I hope Caleb grows his handlebar moustache back by then, because I want something to point and laugh at when I get bored singing along to their foul-mouthed lyrics and perving at Jared. May they wear tight, tight jeans that night. Oh, and just for the record, I do not think smoking is sexy, but that blue eyed bassist definitely is.  Now I'm too hyper to do any uni work. Darn.
1	HEllo All! Well, wonders will never cease.... Cazz do u want to do coffee with me sometime?
1	I am so happy, guys! I am over Jordan-well I have been for a while but the dance and everything just made me realize it so much more. (sighs...) it feels so good to be happy and past an old relationship. I thought I would never be over it, but here I am. Just goes to show that if you rely on God, he can get you through anything! I am so excited! There is no guy in my life right now. Hasn't been since jordan-well nothing that worked out. And that's ok I am going through all of this stuff and God is just helping me find myself-I am getting comfortable and happy in my own skin, but I am not willing to stay the same way. I want to grow constantly. I want to always change for the better. and if a guy becomes part of that, thats fine. I want someone that is growing and getting closer to God and digging into their Bible...I want someone that won't hold me back-just encourage me to grow.  Life is awesome. I just want God. I want whatever he wants for me.  Sweet!
1	Oh my god Yesterday i went to see my private doctor and to let you know i was really surprising about the thing i have heard..It's not the follish joke as everyoneis joking today and so on.But it's getting to much seriously with this.Becky i know you'll gonna be happy when you're gonna hear the news so much as i am and you Bj aswell.I don't know what will Jonatan gonna say plus i still don't know who's the father.Cause I'm pregnant.Yep you heard it right.Karin regards ;) And i'm in Norway now cause of Bjoern's birthday he's turn 24years today loads of love Ash
1	      creepingcrud   ,       zombiehamster   ,       fireborn   --if you haven't given this one a try, you really should.  I'm having a hard time finding a way to describe it.  It's about these little white creatures that are a little like more realistic smurfs, a few of whom run into the real world, if you can call a world with rat beasts and dragons real.  The plot is fun, with just the right balance of humour, cuteness, and some danger.  And the artwork is pretty keen, too.  I guess what I'm saying is try it, I think you'll like it.
0	sad news... rayna died... my python. think it got a little too cold in here... not happy. but she s back outside with Mother gaia now so... shes where she belongs. just wanted to let you know... all of ya who remember her from movie nights. and stuff.
1	New HP fic by        hackthis   ! Definite cause for excitement   Trade  - AU featuring Draco Malfoy head of Malfoy Escorts, Limited  Can not wait to see where this series is going.  Want to know what my favorite song of the moment is? Under My Thumb by the Rolling Stones - I can't stop listening to it.  It makes me want to dance around like an idiot while making lame gestures with my thumb lol.  On top of that I get all these yummy images of a young cocky Mick Jagger.  The Rolling Stones are excellent to wash the dishes to.  Yep that song pleases me marvelous much.

0	My worst nightmare has become a reality. Blink "broke up". Technically, it's only a separation and not a divorce...as shimo would say. I feel like crap all day and then I hear that...fuckin sweet.     Cross your fingers for the best in the future. Long live blink.

1	Well, I pretty much stayed close to home this week.  I went to work, came home, went to bed early.  I needed a rest from the craziness as of late.  Next week, I'll be more back to normal probably.  I went to LUSH on friday.  That was an absolute blast.  I got all sorts of free stuff on top of all the $$ I spent there anyway.  But damn I smell good!  And for whatever reason, I've had cute boys teasing me this week.  Odd, but fun anyhow.  *shrugs*  I need to get back to Man Ray soonish. It's been a while.  Maybe mid - April sometime?  Anyone else interested?  Also - who is going to the Beltane Festival?  (me, me, me)  Reminder:  I'm hosting a party at my house on April 9.   (If you are reading this, you are invited - just let me know if you are coming so I can plan).  I'll send out another reminder closer to it, though.  It should be great fun!
1	my parents took me out to brunch today as an early birthday celebration (my birthday is the 30th so I couldn't have 'em come up then). My brothers were just as irritating as always but oh well. I got a cool Dragon thing as a present. We went to down-town Santa Barbara and along the beach they had people selling all sorts of art stuff and one of the guys makes metal garden thing. One of them was a dragon. so I got it. yay.

0	Classes are killing me.  I want to be home.  I have to go on injections for my MS.  I had to go to the doctor's office alone...I wanted my family.  I just want to curl up in my own bed and sleep.  I think I tried to play it off back at the dorms about how cool it all was, but I think I'm really scared.  I think I need to go hug something...  I think I'm going to go have a cigarette, and another in honor of Mairen.  I hope he gets what's coming to him, my sweet.  ~WSH
0	 how do you respond when your mom tells you    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "you know im just so disappointed in you."    what do you say? how do you respond?    i dont have the slightest clue.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    a. 
1	Because I love children, and they're absolutely adorable at that age.  But....  Haivng to buy toys and play with them as if I were a four-year old is embarrassing. What's more embarrassing is a bunch of 40-something women watching and ooh-ing and aww-ing. *pouts*  I spent today...or rather yesterday... at the school filling in for the pre-kindergarten aide who was out for the day. It was also my day to be observed by my classmates and professor. It all went well...made  a great score on my observations....but if I have to hear "Oishi! You'll make such a wonderful daddy one day!" I'll scream. *pouts again* I have no plans to ever become a father...besides, I'm not a "daddy-type".  Thank God it's Friday, and I have the day off from everything! *cheers*   I haven't seen my boyfriend in days and I'm in Eiji-withdrawl. So instead of being online, I should be in bed, cuddling with him.
0	ssiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.  i hate christmas and my family.   worked tonight....actually kind of wish i was still there. i vote for sleeping and not waking up until i have to return to school.   oh yeah, i would like to thank munnelly for basically fucking up my holiday. i hope she sleeps better at night.

1	Went to the city with Holly, Aaron and Durrant on Friday. T'was awright indeed.   The beginning of  Easter  Spring break has started quite bitterly for everybody it seems. Not so much me - I spent today watching a programme about Simon Cowell and Bicentennial Man (not one programme about the two together; a programme then the film) before not-getting-promoted on PES4 for the third or fourth time. Tommorow I'm going to see Lewis and on Wednesday myself, Holly, Aaron and Durrant are supposed to be going to Pleasurewood Hills. So it's all good really.  All I can be bothered to write ay tee emm.
0	i forgot kari....  how could i have forgotten kari...  she means more to me than almost anyone in the world... i kinda just figured that out of everyone she would have already known all of this. :-/
1	I got a new camera today. It's pretty. I'll finish that picture meme tomorrow hopefully.
0	But I just didn't color her in time for the end of the round. So sorry Lemur. I am in the midst of exams right now, so I don't really have much time to devote to art.         In all hopes I will be able to actually make it into next round.
1	I forgot to mention Jessi!  She was my best friend in my early teens, and I cannot imagine surviving those years without her, but we lost touch over a decade ago.  Well, I've been looking for her online for a few years, and I finally found her!  I called her a couple days ago, and we talked for a while.  It is so nice to know she's alive and well!  She seems to be doing very well for herself, and I'm really looking forward to getting to know her again.  I just got an email from her with a pic of her son, and he looks so much like her older brother did at that age, that it made me squeal! :)  (Ok, the ROTC uniform may have helped with that.)  She's supposed to be sending me a pic of herself, and I can't wait to get it!

1	after many years of watching Fresh Prince of Belair   however you spell it   and the many hilarious movies from Will Smith, never did i think that he was sexy in any way. he was always that tall, funny, black guy with the big ears. but after seeing I,Robot i have a whole different view on him. one of the first scenes is of him in his boxers in his bed. i can tell he's been working out. wow. but after the scene of him in the shower...that's called WHOA. talk about a cute butt! hehehe! oh Will...you have just amazed me this time, you truly have.   ps. I,Robot is a good movie. thumbs up indeed. and Sunny the robot is my homie! YES!
1	God bless the xenon headlight, Mobil 1 Trisyn oil, and the V rated tire.  BTW, today (technically yesterday, since its 12:30) was the first very good day in a long time.  I'm glad I have the friends I have.
1	Date.   What am I going to wear besides bells?   Oh my God.  No time.  Have to shower and get ready.   Ja
0	yea..sorry my thing is so ugly right now..i guess the easiest way to say it is: its under construction. again, sorry about the ugliness ((no offense to anyone who likes it...))
1	fate determined that the best night to have a bizarrely busy tuesday was the night before I go, when I was expecting people to show up at my house at 9 and had no mood for it.  Grr yargh arrh.  But that's ok, 'cause I'm all but totally packed, and ready to roll ... out of bed to a miserable day at 8:00.  And then, ENGLAND!!!  I arrive back around late afternoon/early evening on the 14th.  And I'm so excited you could cry.  Also I got a very nice back rub tonight, yay!  Ok, that's it.  Goodbye Seattle, smell you laterer.
1	  *mutters*&nbsp; Busy, busy, busy...     &nbsp;     M E R R Y  C H R I S T M A S ! ! ! !      &nbsp;     *mutters*&nbsp; Busy, busy, busy...&nbsp; *runs off*       &nbsp;     I LOVE YOU ALL!!!  
1	I bought some new eyes from  http://www.artistique.us/  and I am totally excited about it. I think they were like 3 bucks a pair and shipped like the next day. The quility is really good and I recommend them. I will be buying more eyes from them.     The light brown eyes I bought    light blue    Here she is with the white wig. Miki looks totally unlike herself like this. It is so cool. Its like getting a completely new doll! 
1	I got to see my costume yesterday.... *squeals manically*  George and I both have identical costumes, with dark brown short trousers, cute little brown pixie hats, tights, riding boots, pink shirts (not   quite   sure what that's all about...) and the most GORGEOUS jacket I have ever seen in my life. Really.  It's from the Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves film set (worn by the guards) and is really heavy with yellow puffy sleeves, metal studs and is dark green... If I had the money, I'd buy it. It is, without a doubt, the coolest bit of costume I've ever had in any production. (And I'm including my Nancy-rag-dress for Oliver! and my Digory-Victorian-boy costumes in that.)   We have a full 6 hour rehearsal (IN COSTUME!!!) tomorrow, so if I can, I'll get photos of em. If not, I'll get some by the end of the week.
1	"A beautiful girl can make you dizzy, like you've been  drinking jack and coke all morning.  She can make you feel high, full of the single greatest commodity known to man: promise; promise of a better day, promise of a greater hope, promise of a new tomorrow. This particular aura can be found in the gaze of a beautiful girl: in her smile, and in her soul, and the way she makes every  rotten little thing about life seem like it's gonna be ok." ~TBS~   I found I had written this before on a LJ.  But I love it so much.  Some advice for guys....give this to a girl you like, you will definantly get some!
1	 Since Chris left for the army we have been setting up a room for my sewing machine and stuff and a room for Tom's computers and stuff. One of the changes was to take Chris' bunk bed and put it in the other room (the former kitty room). So - today Tom set the bunks up in there among other moving around of items. He walked over there and called to me and started laughing. He said the boys have decided to use the bunk beds. I went and looked - Hagrid was on the top bunk and Thor was on the bottom bunk. Just like little kids!   I have  got  to get a digital camera. Shots like that are too precious to keep passing up! 
0	last night i played at a benefit concert for freedom house... ooh was it nice.  it felt so good to play again... i need to stop looking at my hands so much though.  i have it on video tape, and i think it's digital so maybe we'll be able to put clips on my  website .    basketball games are going to be on from 1 til midnight today.  what am i supposed to write here?

0	Hi! My name is Tiffany. And guess what? I suck. Everything I do is never enough for anyone, and I'll never get the respect that I deserve. Nothing that I say or do is taken seriously, and people just assume I'm a failure at everything.  But one day I'll show them...  I just want to get out of Stafford.....
0	Tragedy strikes again – two days ago I noticed that Sir Edmund of Kintyre was no longer responding to his medication and seemed to be in considerable pain/discomfort. He was bloated, his colour was dull (which never happened to him), he could barely swim, and was constantly found resting at the bottom, usually at an awkward angle. A pitiable sight to see for sure – he wouldn’t have lasted too much longer. So unhappy looking was he that I researched the most humane way to euthanize a fish – according to many sources, clove oil was the answer. So I bought two vials from Rite Aid. That night, I held a little ceremony and tearfully put him to sleep. Miss Serenity has been staring longingly at his bowl all morning – I feel her pain, but at least Edmund doesn’t feel his.
1	Well I had a voice recital tonight that went really well so I'm happy.  I got a bunch of complements which made me happy, though since it was a student recital I wish I had gotten a few more critiques so that I could work on improving.  I love singing musical theater though and everyone said that was apparent. Basically I had really good characterization.  :)   Otherwise I'm just excited for this weekend: FRIDAY - TACKY PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Nough said! SATERDAY - Blake Shelton and Emerson Drive concert at Cattle Annie's - and I got tickets for a sweet $15 bucks.  It's gonna rock! SUNDAY - Auditions for our senior show!  Other than the load of homework I have due on Monday and Tuesday this weekend is going to rock!  Lots and lots of fun.  :)
0	Justin get the EFF over here..I don't care when, just do it.
1	i went on a bit of a spending spree this past week at the old navy.  bought some new jeans and some interesting shirts.  we'll see how the masses like them.  i got these pj pants that are pink with frogs on them.  i love frogs!  looking forward to being an honorary irish person tomorrow for st patrick's day ala kelly.  eric and i decided to go up to bowling early and join the others in celebration.  i have a feeling i probably won't bowl too well but whatever.  it will just be fun to party with eric all night:D  of course, thursday class might really suck.  not much else.  the semester is half over but i still have a lot of work to do.  i am still procrastinating but i wouldn't be me if i didn't.  but, actually, i think i am about to go upstairs and study neuro.  i know, i've gone crazy.  well, everyone, have a happy and safe st. patty's day!

1	It's been a good day.  I woke up to great news.  My aunt and uncle had their baby early this morning.  Four weeks premature, but Allison Nicole Brooks weighs 7 pounds 5 ounces, and seems to be in great health.  Thank God.  No birth defects detected, as of now...  Please keep this baby in your prayers.  Hopefully i'll be going upstate soon to see the newest addition to the family.  :)  On another note, I also got invited to go to a wedding in August.  My mom's friend's daughter is getting married, and they asked if I wanted to go.  I'm like, sure!  Maybe there'll be a cute single boy there for me to play with.  :)    That's about it for now...  Had today off so I've been laying around and napping.  Leave a message.  :)

The only thing I'll ever ask of you, You gotta promise not to stop when I say when. She sang.'-Foo Fighters  Tim i'm still offended you like the acoustic better.  Things just dont' work out for me i suppose...the last thing i want to do is move home but i can't afford to not be there. Freedom has a hefty price...a price a fuck up can't afford. So here's to my last few days of freedom...and i'm already really depressed.
0	 My father accidentally called me while trying to reach my brother this evening.&nbsp; He told me that my parents' good friend and neighbor Sandy is dying tonight.&nbsp; She's been dying all day, in fact, and my dad kissed her good-bye at two different times today.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, after the Quarter-Hourly Bowel Report, Grandma talked about her own mother's view of death.&nbsp; "She always said, 'Dying isn't easy.'"&nbsp; And for her, it wasn't.&nbsp; At the age of 66, she lost a long, drawn-out battle with lung cancer.&nbsp; Sandy, 58, also dies as a result of being a lifelong smoker.&nbsp;  She's been dying all day.&nbsp;  Oh God, don't let it end for me that way.    &nbsp;    &nbsp; 
1	Ok well I finally came back from the Grand Canyon. I had a lot of time. I bonded with my family we got on each others nerves at some times but it was funny now that I think about it… I took a lot of pictures when I get a chance I will post them up. The town we stayed out had a population of like 100 it was a ghost town. It was freezing. The mornings were 30 degrees. In all I had a great time   TWO MORE WEEKS OF SCHOOL!!!!
1	Not like anyone reads this, but uh.. Here's an update.  I'm alive.
1	it's cool that so far the only school-related work i have done this weekend is 4 calculus problems. then they got too hard for me to bother attempting any more. tomorrow will be FUN, but the last day of a weekend is always for homework so it's okay.   yesterday i went to the library just for fun, to get myself more books to read. i've gotten really addicted to reading and i like it. none of the books on my list were there, so instead i looked at the recommended reading list and got a couple from that.. now i am reading the dogs of babel, so far it's pretty good.  my cousin is here visiting from nyc for the weekend, so we've had fun. also i like my friends. i guess that's a good/normal thing, but seriously.
1	I fell down a 5 set today. Ouch!!!! I liked it though. I love the feeling I have that motivates me to try again. Some people would say that sex is the best feeling in the world. I disagree, making love is great, however there are things in life that can beat it, for example: Falling down a set of stairs and the motivation I get to try it again, Doing a perfect bunny hop during the break down of a song, and hearing someone tell me how much they love me after I told them.
1	Tonight I registered for my last classes as an undergraduate. Granted I will still have to register for student teaching for next spring, but this is the last of my actual classes at NKU.

1	I played my song for one of my friends today, she said that it made her feel something more than she had ever felt in her life. That is all I've ever wanted, and now I've acomplished it. I am thinking of getting a gallary for my art, so that I can post some of my work here and people would see it. Maybe then people would understand me, and my mind. But probably that is a little to much to ask, my art has a different style to it, that not many could understand. One of these days I'll have a gallary all to myself, a real one. And you will have to pay to come see my greatness. Wow for the egotisticals. I'm not really that egotistical I'm promise. I wonder what my plans are for the evening, it is the weekend. I should get a call or two inviting me to hang out, hint hint. Or I'll just paint some more. What do you think? Oh, and your welcome.
1	One more icon to add to the list and I have to admit I really like this one, so it's going up as the default. My thanks go out to       rustedxmagick    for making this for me!
1	i am so over the whole school thing.  it is too stressful.  I LOVE LIFE!!!!  haha i just like being happy... and I am because I totally got my car yesterday and it is amazing and i am so blessed to have the most sweet, kind grandmother ever who buys cars for her little grandkids on their 16th birthday... even if mine was like a few months ago.  if anyone wants a ride... haha you know where to call :)  i am very confused about boys... it is a long story but sometimes i think i like *insert names* and then other times i don't know!!!  and then theres this friend of mine...  but that would be so awful!  yeah so lets all just have a good weekend, mmkay?  p.s. i feel like such a failure in band lately :(  it makes me sad

1	I just spent the whole evening studying with Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hannah, Neville, and a bunch of others in the Library. I don't think I've ever been this prepared for a Transfiguration exam in my life. Thanks guys!  Anyway, on to more interesting matters. I'm so excited about the ball!! I bought my dress with the girls at Hogsmeade last weekend, and I can't wait. I still can't believe my luck.  Hermione had a muggle camera with her at Hogsmeade, and took some pictures of some of us trying on dresses. I'm not sure if I want to display my dress just yet though, or if I want it to be a surprise.  I had so much fun with you girls, we need to do more stuff together! You're all awesome, and if you need any help getting ready for the ball, you know where to find me. And if you don't, you can always send an owl =).  Hope everyone's having a great day.  Love always,  ~Parvati
1	Anthony is coming home soon! Very soon! And then I can stop worring about him.  And I will be very happy.  And he will be safe once again. Whoo hoo! And we will have a new baby girl added to our little family, and we will be together, and everything will be as it should be. Then we'll go back to Drum, and it'll be just like before. I can't wait! See? Even the baby is excited. She just started kicking really hard when I wrote down that her daddy is coming home. She can't wait either!

0	I found out two devestating things today. I'm not allowed to return to UVic next year, and I've missed the deadline for basically every other college in the country so it seems I won't be going to school at all again ever and my uncle is dead. My parents won't let me fly home for the funeral. Dammit, he's my uncle! It's not like I'm gonna miss any exams or anything. Besides, what's it matter now anyway? I can't go back to school, so why should I worry about my exams? Why don't I just leave and never come back? I think that sounds like a smashing idea. I hurt so much right now. I don't wann leave, but on the same token, if it's futile to be here, I'd rather be home. I hate the world  so much  right now. Why did he have to die now? Why couldn't he have held on until May so I could have said goodbye? This isn't fair. I can't even say my goodbyes at the funeral. I just wanna scream until my lungs hurt. Damn it all.    I'm pushing zero. Where is my hero?  
1	  so...brent came over tonight. it was fun. I was afraid he was bored though because all we had to do was watch t.v. and I felt weird talking around my parents when they were there..I don't know why. I didn't give him his special hug...cause I was being stupid about it and afraid he didn't want me to cause I'm stupid. lol. He's so CUTE. lol. I'm weird...dude his Punisher tat is so awesome...I love it. I didn't know he had one til I read a survey thing on his LJ. Sooo...I like him..:-P I guess you got that already...I'm glad my parents didn't say anything embarrassing..that would have been terrible. They were good so it's all gravy...They went to bed before I got home so I don't know their opinion yet but I can tell my dad liked him...and my mom seemed to too so it's all gravy :) Well, I'm outta here for now..later. &hearts; Jess

1	I am now going to dutifully fulfill my obligation to fandom and say that if you watch Lost on Wednesdays and absolutely love it (and most people I know do)... then you really must keep the channel on after Lost tomorrow to watch the 2-hour season premiere of Alias (created by the same guy who made Lost - JJ Abrams). Most of my friends already watch Alias, but just in case anyone stumbles upon my journal who doesn't.... the lovely       lavellebelle    has listed many many many good reasons to watch at her journal...

0	Another WT pic. This was taken before the Madrid show, but I wasn't sure it'd survive the journey, so didn't mentioned it. Actually I've got two more, with Martin and Jeroen, but they look blurry and too dark because of the light, so when I scan them all you see are two big shadows. I noticed that just before the Sharon and Robert one was taken.           And a new icon. Don't like the 'anymore' font that much though. For those interested, if you read the small letters too it would say 'I don't believe in love anymore'. Word.
1	Take the quiz:  "What Kinda Kiss R U?"     Romantic Kiss  Lying in bed after making love and just doing whatever.
1	A friend at work sent me a link to  http://www.itunesregistry.com/ .  Its a cool web page where you can upload your iTunes XML information file.  It then lets you generate all kinds of reports and graphs about the kinds of music you listen to. Very interesting....  From there I found a neat little program called  iChatStatus  that takes the song information from iTunes and puts it into you online status comments for iChat. Neat!
1	Frank Miller's  Sin City  opens Friday.  It's another Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino directed film with another loaded cast.  It looks like this weekend is planned out, so I'll probably set something up next weekend.
1	Well, the couple who introduced my husband and I had their first baby this morning. A big, healthy baby girl. Welcome to the world!
0	Well, I just found something out. My major asshole brother has brain washed my mother.  Now because my dad tells my mom the truth she told him to leave. Is that wrong. Yes. She told him to leave. My brother is worthless. There is nothing here for him. I think he should just leave. He is 18. He is graduated. He works at a damn grocery store at night, and now he wants to become an ART TEACHER give me an effing break. He will never suceed at anything.   Now everything I have is gonna change. Half of the time my mother cannot stand me so what makes her think that I will have it better too without my dad. If she was smart she would remember that I am daddy's little girl. He is hard on my brother but maybe because my brother is lazy and stupid. I wish my brother would leave.
1	 Thank you So much Ivana for cheering me up!!!! Singing My Chemical Romance - Im not okay!!  It Was Perfect!  :-D  
0	a year ago in march my family and i had to put my childhood dog Shadow to sleep.   late last night at the emergency after hours animal hospital, we had to put my 5 year old pug Gizmo to sleep.   i feel nothing but heartache. constantly.   the house just doesnt feel the same when i enter.
1	HAPPY WEDDING DAY, CLAY AND STEPHANIE!!!  * How exciting!* Lets hope that the rain holds off! :o) Off to get my hair done...
1	Just listening to the latest/last Elliott Smith album,  From a Basement on the Hill , and it's great.  I think this is his "happiest" album ever, but it's still him.  It's a pity he died last year, because I really think he was one of the best songwriters out there.  What's played on the radio can't hold a candle to Elliott.
1	I have kept forgetting to post that I got a 95/100 on my first test in my East Asian Politics class, which I mentioned below.  I was surprised I got that high of a grade, which I am very happy with, just was not expecting it. :)
1	I wound up staying up for 31 hours straight before finally getting to sleep for four. Then I couldn't sleep anymore. I predict keeling over very soon.  But I helped deliver two baby girls yesterday. Which was so, SO awesome. Although I nearly had a heart attack when the second baby's head started to loll. But then I managed to prop it up and get her in the baby-warmer-bed and she was kicking like a very mad little kicking and crying thing, so it was all good.   Rounds took forever because both myself and the resident were dead on our feet. But he was grateful I stayed even after he said I could go, and bought me breakfast out of gratitude. On the way home, there was a detour, and traffic was no fun, but I made it in one piece. Showered, and fell into bed until the sun woke me up by shining square on my face and I couldn't get back to sleep.  But I keep grinning like an idiot.  I got to help deliver two babies. Hee. :)
0	My bosoms have returned to me, and all is right in the world.  Now if only Ronald did not have to lose his.
1	Basically I can't wait for tomorrow to be over! I leave for Maui on Wednesday morning and I am completely pumped!! Things have been going fairly well lately, I really cant think of anything that has gone wrong. I have reached a turning point and I am SO ready to graduate. I was really apprehensive earlier this year, but now that I know whats going on and have a plan for next year, I cant wait to move on. The rest of this year should be fun, and I'm going to try to make the best of it! But as for now, Spring Break is all I can think of! Yay! MAUI HERE I COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	It's time for the annual  ESPN Page 2 Hottest Male Athlete  polling and for some horrifying reason, the guy below is in the running. Initially. Hopefully the straight women and gay men participating in the poll will be reasonable and sensible AND GET HIM AWAY FROM THE HOT MALE ATHLETES. Gawd. I can't believe he's in the sname bracket as Andy Roddick, Michael Phelps and Barry Zito. Having him on the same webpage as the cute boys might give them the ugly disease!!     He's some Judo dude name Jimmy. I think the stupid people at ESPN Page 2 were trying to spread the love across all the sports, but shit. That don't work, people!! The only hot male athletes play baseball! (My humble opinion. :-P)
0	Dave's priorities in life (IN ORDER)  1. SMOKING POT 2. SEX 3. DRINKING 4. JEFF 5. TAYLOR 6. DREW 7. ME 8. SCHOOL 9. MEETING MY FRIENDS  Fucked up huh?  Yeah, I've come to the conclusion that that's how it is.  And I'm pretty sure that I shouldn't be anywhere NEAR the bottom of that list.  But that's just me.  I'm upset, maybe I'm overreacting, but I don't think so.
0	I called HP's SMB sales division today to ask if they would be able to sell me the  nx5000 w/ Linux  only without the HPW500 and with the Intel Pro Wireless 2200 in its place. After some hold time, the sales rep said he wasn't able to include that request with the order as a line item either installed or sold separately. I think I may purchase the Linux laptop regardless. So far, it seems that the one con (the HPW500) is outweighed in goodness by the 15" screen upgrade. So, I'll continue my research and see if I can't find a better solution before I take the dive.
1	Happy New Years to all! Todays tip:  Before you begin drinking tonight take $ Vitamin B tablets and you can avoid a hang over.  And if its to late for that before you go to bed take an aspirin and have a shot of coffee(no sugar) and drink a glass of water to help curb the New Years Day hang over.
1	I have a little sister now!  I am so proud to be Jess' big sister!  It's so cool and I'm way excited and I'm sure I will be making tons of crafties and thereby totally avoiding my schoolwork, but she's totally worth it so I don't care.  That is all.  Oh wait!  Except for this:  YEAH BETA OMEGA ON OUR ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY!
0	of loss?  Why didn't he love me enough to work it out?  What did I do to deserve this heartache.  I so want to be able to call him and tell him what a self-absorbed, ass of a person he really is,  but he is in a new relationship, and is all happy and stuff.  I want him to hurt and suffer the way I have, but as my family says he has no heart and probably will never feel that way, and it jsut pisses me off.  I want to put him out of my mind, but I don't know how.  Will he ever regret not working it out...I know I probably will be thankful in the long run that it didn't, but right now I just wish it did.  Is he loving this other girl as much as he said he did me?  I feel like I was his mistake and he will learn what he did wrong... or what I did wrong, in his eyes and won't do that again.  Therefore he will be happy and I don't want him too.

0	It's so sad.  I just heard about a kid in the Cambridge Springs area that killed himself. I guess that just shows how up to date I am on everything.  School is just strange this year because I have NO friends anymore.  My "last resources," as I call them now are gone, which is actually good, because nobody liked them, and they were whores, so now all I have left are: Phia, Bryana, Ashlee and Katelyn.  I actually prefer to have a minimal amount of friends, but I thought they were minimal last year...woot.  In my spare time I'm going to make a list of who my friends were last year and who they are now...  Actually, I'm supposed to be working on my homework, but once again I needed to get that off my chest.  There has been a lot of things bugging me and I think it's finally coming into play.  A lot of it has to do with last year.  I'm wondering why it is just now starting to get to me???

1	I am  such  a hopeless romantic... I swear I could shake myself sometimes! It's really quite sad. Anywho... just finished watching 'The Prince and Me' with Julia Stiles and Luke Mably (*swoon*). It was a wonderful movie... very romantic and funny, with just the right amount of angst (and boy does he look good without a shirt on)... now, if only I could scrape up some cash so I could add it to my collection ;) Honestly, if any of you girls haven't seen it yet - I highly recommend it!! Well, now that I'm all soppy and pathetic, I think I'll run off before I start throwing myself at random men, lol!!
1	After this weekend i realize that I dont really care about being the weirdo who goes home all the time.  I love it at home.  I have more fun there than here.  So I will go home whenever i feel like it.   HA HA!  so anyway.  I had a crazy dream about the mackinaw bridge being a roller coaster and being in toys r us and then gina swimming in a pool in the middle of the woods.  It was weird.  The parents are out of town Saturday...that is going to be fun.  But otherwise... my life is boring.  I just finished a paper...yahoo!  have a good one.   YAY GREEK!!!!
1	Cat got into New York University.  I'm so incredibly happy for her and proud of her.  She completely deserves it.
0	Sometimes I feel inadequate.  Don't I deserve to be happy too?
1	Tonight was so fun :). I had a really good time !!! =)
0	I only just found out early this morning--while at work, no less---that Christopher Reeve passed away this weekend.  To say I'm dismayed, stunned or sorrowed would be an understatement.  Here I was thinking everything was going fairly smoothly for him, and he's slipped away.  No, I didn't know him, but I mourn his passing because he was a part of my life growing up. The Superman movie was a special one that my Dad and I share, one of the bonds we have. Dad even used to style his hair like Christopher's hair was in the movie, and he has the same sort of smile and look about him. I guess it hits close to home, in some ways.  But I am still reeling from the news.  RIP, Christopher Reeve. Superman. May you always fly, and reach out to touch the face of God.
0	oh well today was complete and utter shit day .... where to start  I GOT ALL MY FUCKING CDS STOLEN !!!!!  sooooo if anyone is feeling generous ... i am accepting donations since i have nothing to listen to.... i dont mind burned copies...not to mention alot of the shit i had in my booklet was either shit i cant find like my retardobot cds....

0	I just want to break down and cry, but I really have nothing to be trully sad about except that I am find that some people that I use to trust I can not longer trust, people that I have listened to over and over again about their problems won't take the time to listen to my problems, and I hate when people think that they know me to say things to me or other people that are not true.

1	 I AM GOING TO LONDON IN JULY!!! EEEE!!   My dad is the bestest of all dads - I'm not sure why but on my birthday he offered, out of the blue, to buy us both a trip to London, as he has never been there and I keep moaning about wanting to go there again but not being able to afford it because London is expensive yo. But since now I don't have to pay for the flight or the hotel, I should be able to scrape together enough money for some shopping and sightseeing right? I got enough on my birthday to cover food expenses I think but since I tend to go teh crazeh over shopping whenever I go to London I'm thinking I need to figure out a way to make some more money. Any ideas?   London summer sales starts in early July right?
0	Sasha and I made this beautiful snowman last night. His name was Fred. We both liked him alot. And when I came back from class this morning he had been nihilated!       Someone killed Fred the snowman!!  =(    Rest in Peace Fred. You will be forever missed.   the only thing that's left is his bottom and his midsection is splattered all over the place. His head is decapitated and they scapled him (he had hair a.k.a. evergreen branches.)... it truly is a sad day.   Fred E-3 February 22, 2005 - February 23, 2005.  "It was a glourious 15 hours."             - Fred

1	The scary paper is done and ready to be turned in.  I don't want to go to class tonight and I seriously think that I might just turn in my paper and cut out early because I have a midterm to write tonight for my Shakespeare class tomorrow.  I'd love to be able to watch  American Idol  with my brother and then rewatch the OTH Wedding...because there is Jake!nakedness and that's hot.  I want sushi.

1	Thanks for the movie and food, guys =)  Sorry we didn't get much time to chat.  When we left Borders I thought we were meeting up again elsewhere, so I didn't really say thanks and goodbye.
1	 Just spent the most delightful time with Charlie.  He's such a gentleman.  He's so adorable.  And the best thing is ...     HE LIKES ME FOR ME!    No one has really done that before ... its been who I could be or how I could change.  Not with Charlie.  He's so ...  different  
0	Hey all,   Will I just wanted to do one little update before I go to bed.

Made me feel all happy inside :D *titter titter*.  Al was sposed to call me tonight.. but he never.. mst had stuff to do.. :( i dont think I'm going to be able to go to his place for new years like i thought.

1	sometimes things feel hopeless. u think everything is bad and there isnt any good in anyone anymore. and then... things start to change......
0	I thought I heard "Battle of Evermore" coming from Emily's room just now. I was about to be impressed until I got closer and found it was only the Dixie Chicks.    Drat.
1	 Thought you guys would enjoy some pictures!    &nbsp;    &nbsp;                                           
1	 My mom and i went shopping for a baby shower and we got little Wiggly socks!  That are so cute.  They also had wiggly p.j.'s but I couldnt convince her to get those :) 
1	I made the right choice last night to go home after snowboarding instead of going to get baked all night....At the time i wanted to shoot myself for the decision.  But anyways, I saw Justin at powder ridge..and I am sooo in love w/him. I thought I wrecked my chance of ever being w/him again..but that's wrong..all wrong.  We snowboarded for a while, then we went to the gas station so he could buy my some ciggs....he did...and then when I got home he was on the internet..&gt;(very weird) So ofcourse i Had to talk to him....well it was a NICE conversation...when he's living closer to me next yr, well I'll have him :)!  Now I just gotta loose 15 lbs....I CAN! i will for him....even w/o getting my ed back..i'm suree!

1	I believe my room is eating my/others possessions. o_O My cell phone charger, Frankie the remote [GOD, I miss Frankie!], the pass key...But, as I'm the luckiest damn person to walk the face of this pathetic planet - I had no pass key and was hoping someone would be in the computer lab to let me in. Alas, no one was, but - gasp - the door was already open, which it *never* is. And it's almost 7 p.m. ^_^ So I'm good now.
1	i've decided to have a little going away party for myself, since i prolly won't get to see half of you otherwise.  august 10 anytime after 7 or 7:30ish my house  please come!!

1	OMG  SONGMEANINGS.NET IS BAAACCCCK!!!!!!!!!!!!       YEYYYYYY
1	So.  Day of actually class-i-tude.  Syntax totally kicks ass, especially if       miss_polyglot    ends up being able to sit in.  French Phonetics is all nifty, but if I get into Lit 42M, I'm dropping it.  Even though we get to do Enchainement.  I totally spelled that wrong.   THE LIT CLASS.   MY GOD.  Reading for this weekend?   The Hobbit.   THE HOBBIT.    Dude, this class is going to be sooooooo awesome.  And you know why I really win? (Well,       gwenlle    and I win.)  One of the teachers reads HP slash.  I have found my new home.  On the other hand, the class is completely full, and I'm sixth on the waiting list-- the full size of the class is 20, by the way.  Even if I can't register, though, I'm still going to audit it.  Dude.  Anyway, I'm trying to get more sleep than I did last term, so I'm calling it a night.  -S
1	 Yeah...so school was way better today..still somewhat boring though. But I made a friend!(ha...) and introduced myself and talked to a guy..I think his name is David...(lol he said his name sort of fast). so hurrah...! 
1	I think today was a good day, aside from the whole middle school fiasco but even that wasn't really a big deal.  I'm very happy that baseball is going to start soon- possibly next week.  Although that means I'm going to have to run some to get back in shape.  Oh well, I'll still be much better off than a lot of people.  Farm machinery show trip tomorrow, no one will be at school.  Hopefully we won't do anything in any classes then.
0	Man...  Ballet was...not good. It wasn't that I couldn't dance or anything, even though I was screwing up combinations left and right. It was just the training. The teacher was more encouraging than anything, and she never downright corrected me like I need. It wasn't even that the classes were big. It was just that I was the best dancer there, and when you're the best dancer there in a class full of people who obviously don't have your level of training, you don't get any attention.  I mean, I am not in shape. I'm not. So I figure this studio will keep me until January, when classes start at COCA. I have high hopes for COCA. I will be going there on Wednesday, and hopefully they will be more professional. The money is about the same, except COCA is tuition. I think you can pay monthly there, though.  My feet hurt. My everything is going to hurt tomorrow. It's so refreshing to use muscles that you haven't used in a while.  I miss  really  being able to dance. :(
0	So here we are, Christmas time again.  The time for families and the hustle and bustle of happy celebrations. Well, this Christmas-aholic has this year off.  Yes folks, I'm ignoring Christmas despite my obsession with decoration, buying presents and Christmas music (thought I will admit, I have cracked and am listening to Trans-Siberian Orchestra).  So what am I up to?  Absolutely nothing.  Bored stiff.  I'm thinking of leveling my white mage (Final Fantasy XI) but I really don't feel like it.  Maybe a movie. *shrug* If you see me on Aim PLEASE talk to me as I am more than likely bored out of my mind and very excited to see your message on my screen.  Happy Holidays everyone.
0	I have run into difficulty getting reimbursed for a dyslexia grant I got from my pHD funding councel. Basically to cut a long story short the universities accounting system is crap and so rather than go through the university I entered a private agreement with a person to read and help me with my reading.  This the funding body were fine with, but they now say the reciepts don't match their accounting standard. What constitutes a reciept? Can I make new ones and predate them. Is there a level to which a reciept must conform? Any help and any case law deeply appreciated, and don't worry I will consider advice and info a just friendly pub chat and not a professional opinion.  heather :(
0	"You have no idea the odds of me seeing that star, but ya know it would have been just as amazing of a ngiht if I didn't see it because either way I saw you...and thats always enough for me. I just never really expected any of this it just all happened so fast. You truly are such a huge part of my life I wish I could freeze frame every moment we share because each moment is special in certain ways, and each so different. I meant what I said, and I know you meant what you said, and I'm glad it was said cause it has been felt for a while, I could see it in your eyes. Even if they are "just brown" they will never be that too me. Thanks for waking me up from my nightmare and giving me something to dream about"   ...on with the tears will this day just end.

1	Beloved Sports Night - why did I ever leave you?   [Note:  Where is #46?]
0	So be it, I’m your crowbar If that’s what I am so far Until you get out of this mess  And I will pretend That I don’t know of your sins Until you are ready to confess  But all the time, all the time I’ll know, I’ll know  And you can use my skin To bury secrets in And I will settle you down  And at my own suggestion, I will ask no questions While I do my thing in the background  But all the time, all the time I’ll know, I’ll know   Baby-I can’t help you out, while she’s still around  So for the time being, I’m being patient And amidst this bitterness If you’ll just consider this-even if it don’t make sense All the time-give it time  And when the crowd becomes your burden And you’ve early closed your curtains, I’ll wait by the backstage door  While you try to find the lines to speak your mind And pry it open, hoping for an encore  And if it gets too late, for me to wait For you to find you love me, and tell me so It’s ok, don’t need to say it.
0	Okay so I am like...I just dunno anymore about anything. I mean there are no problems with anything but I am just I guess you could say...not happy. I don't even know why. I should be very happy. I have a great boyfriend and well my true friends are the only ones who still stay by my side. I need to like...fix this because I am more depressed lately than I have been and I really don't like it. School...well we're getting there. And family...well I juss don't talk to hardly anyone except my older bro. Chris...things are good most of the time. Friends well I have just come the concept that the only true friends I have will still be there after all is said and done. Oh! It's raining! great! Makes me want to dance in the rain. Lmao! Anywayz well I am going but yeah. Umm. Whit...is it over? Chris. Love ya and UPDATE! I'm out.
1	As many of you know, I did adopt  Banzai  and  Beamer  from the shelter.  I've had them a little over two weeks now, things have been going well (as I type they're walking through my legs - they want to go to bed).  I've taken some pictures with my phone and have been meaning to post them, but I've wanted to get  Gallery  setup on my machine first, which I've kept putting off.  I installed it earlier today, so I have to get it configured, then I'll post lotsa pictures of kitties.  To tide you over,  have a kitty !
1	And I found out David Lochner is going to Life in the Spirit at the weekend! Wheeeeee! That deserves a dancing Banana!

1	          My pirate name is:               Bloody Bartholomew Kidd                   Every pirate lives for something different. For some, it's the open sea. For others (the masochists), it's the food. For you, it's definitely the fighting. Even though you're not always the traditional swaggering gallant, your steadiness and planning make you a fine, reliable pirate.    Arr!          Get your own pirate name from fidius.org.     
1	Hi hi everyone. How are all of you? ^_^ I've been busy with work lately cuz for a while it was just me and Aunt Purita working, so I had to work everyday. But now I've trained a new girl  named Jamie, and she's really nice. My aunt thinks that I'm stealing money from the Candy Store. O.o What reason do I have to do that? Anyway, whatever. Right now I'm over at Karla's, babysitting for her. It's been a while since I've done this. ^_^ I kinda missed it, except for the fact that I had to bring Mila with me today. -_-" She's such a pain and of course never listens. Well, gonna go now. Take care everyone. I miss all of you. ^_^
0	and it doesn't look like it'll improve any time soon.

0	According to cnn.com, the Pope has died.  : (  Edit to clarify: Yes, I'm Jewish.  But it's still sad, he was a good man and he did a lot to help a lot of people in the world as well as to try and make relations between Jews and Catholics better.
1	Sarah & Kelly told me to write about them, they're in the same cabin at camp! They're cool! You should worship them. I dunno why, you just should. In other news, I saw "I, Robot" today. Fscking. Great. Movie. I lurved it. I'll  definitely  go see it again. ^-^ Good movie. Yeah. I wanna read the book now... But anyhoo... Yeah, that's about it...
1	I'm going to be a father.....   What a turn of events, but excited. It's gonna be ok.   ...Jesus Christ
1	Today was pretty good. I got a little more into the Christmas spirit. We had our little party and Fani, Sea Sea, Aylee, Tristan and Candice came over and Lyss stopped by for like a minute. I ate some good food and had some good talks with the girls and Tris. I still want a new nickname!!! Anyways, then me and Candice took a little nap together and now I'm wide awake! I looked in the fishtank in my living room and I saw a really pretty fish. It was the kind that I have been wanting. I asked my mom about it and she finally told me that it was one of my presents...oops haha. I know like every single thing I got now. I'm too damn good. Well tomorrow should be good, at least in the morning. After that it gets kind of boring so if anyone is doing anything call me! 503-8153...  Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! &lt;3 Teenie Babel
1	hey hall im doin great this is my 2nd week of fasting.i feel great
1	 No  hair!  I've gone from having waist-length hair - dead as a doornail, mind you - to just-past shoulder length hair. It's all layered (short around the face and longer at the back) and sorta  flicked  at the ends. It'll take some getting used to.      I didn't realise my hair got so dark in winter.     Blurry!    It's messy in this pic, but you can see the layers at the back.   Okay, bad pics. You can't actually see the layers, but they're there! It's much shorter around the face (really frames it) and goes longer (bra strap ish) at the back. Still,  much  shorter than it was, but it's healthy now! Hopefully it'll grow  healthier  now and I'll have it back to its old length in next to no time. I'm going to get highlights and that'll really help define it all.   Also, reason 10292894397829374 why I have the best Dad ever:       And finally, check out the new mood theme! Thanks to the wonderful       kyoht    :) *is far too lazy to make her own*.
1	Fridays rawk!  Well at 5pm they do anyways.  I really like working here, I feel like I belong hehe corny I know.  I'm going over my mum and dads house tonight, for some r&r mum is going to redo my roots, I've got to fix her computer, and we're going shopping on Saturday for Christmas presents.  Last time we went shopping for Christmas presents I just ended up buying things for myself! hehe.  I need to buy a pretty dress for the client christmas party, I'm going to look so cute with my blonde hair and pink dress!  Weekends yay!
0	i'm in a weird mood now. just got done talking to loop about her love life over the phone. i'm starting to wonder about that whole idea of love; usually, i'm kind of bitter about the whole thing, thinking that i'm going to be 80 someday and never have fallen in love, but right now it doesn't really seem worth it. it's like being friends with someone is cool, friends is fun, friends are there for you, but the second love enters the equation everything gets all fucked up. love always seems so fucking tragic; it skews the world into some shape where the only things that matter are you and your screwed up romantic traumas. i don't know. by tommorow i'll probably be dreaming for my white knight in black leather again, but right now i feel like love seems pretty pointless. when something hurts you more than helps you, it's usually not a good.
1	Remember how my lock fucked up last night and i couldn't get into my room? Well, the office sent everyone on campus this telephone message this morning telling everyone to check their locks because of an incident that happened last night when a student couldn't get into their room. Well, that was me. So now i'm really going to be the talk of the town, because it always seems that for me at least, when something like this happens, its usually the main subject on everyone's lips. Ah well, i don't care...at least this time its not THAT bad. :P
0	KAIULANI'S GONNA HAVE A MAKEOVER! I'LL PROVE IT! SEE...     Oh NO!   UPDATE: Maybe it's not so bad after all. She now looks more like an angel cat instead of a white blob that has a few cat features ... quote my mum - who, by the way, has a cold.
0	Bill, my laptop of three years has died again. And instead of trying a resurrection, I am pulling the plug. It just isn't worth the hassle any more.   I loved Bill. He was my companion throughout long periods of unemployement, kept me connected to people I love like Marilyn and Rolf, gave me lots of gaming pleasure and followed me all over the house, bedroom, living room, dining room...  But I can't afford to keep fixing him up every three months. So it was organ donation time as I removed his memory and donated them to my office PC who I had lovingly christened: Ted.   He suffered a lot...frequently overheating from long periods of use, what with my siblings making him suffer through much rough handling and RO sessions.   I'll miss you, Bill. And I'm crippled without you. Ah, life.
0	It seems like whatever I try to do to make me happy is insufficient. Everything I ever did that i thought would make me really happy did'nt do it. I feel like I can only enjoy things after they are gone, but then I miss them. While they are around however, I am not happy that they are. Sorry if I confused anyone...It's hard to write it down so it makes sense.
0	I miss Cc lol grr my house is so fuckin boreing i want to go live ... idk not here at my house i hate this shit i have to watch madison till like 9 or 11 tonight sarah is workin at subway ahahah... but thats suck 4 me cause i gotta watch madi.grr i miss you cc...
1	So.. i feel really great i've been hanging out...etc.  life is weird ... like everyone is crazy but everyone makes sense everyone is the way they r because of everything in their lives.... who they grew up with... if their lives were stable... the amount of money they had... the shows they watched... but even with all of that.. i still think that ppl r born with characteristics.. like for instance.. i never knew my dad but i am very VERY much like he was ... how weird....  that's always been a mystery to me... but it makes me happy  LATERS LUV YAS
1	I found out today that       jamjar    wrote the absolutely wonderful  Skip  for me for this year's Yuletide challenge. It's Ferris Bueller's Day  Off slash, Ferris/Cameron pairing, and has both voices down perfectly. There's a reason it's been recced all over, and I'm so thrilled with it.  Thank you so much, Jamjar. Now that you've been revealed, I'm going to go explore your other stuff.  As for me, I wrote My Own Private Idaho fic for       cesperanza   . I was really surprised how little fic there was for it (I think I found one other story besides the one that was written for it on last year's Yuletide.) I bet if it was more recent, there would be lots more, and very likely some good Keanu/River RPS.

1	i'm packingup the laptop for the weekend as soon as i'm done with this post!  have a great weekend everyone!!!  song of the week: comfortable-john mayer
1	OK, so I never really update, so here one is.  I've been really busy this semester.  I take chemical structure and an associated computer-based lab that is a ton of work, chem-majors' physics, multivariable calculus, and a stupid seminar on strategy.  I still have my chem and physics exams ahead of me.  I'll be back in town on the 21st.  My roommate has been really sick.  I do honor advising, which basically means I'm being trained to help people involved in honor proceedings.  I do sports radio which is really sweet, especially since it's on a real commercial radio station.  I do some tutoring for people who never show up, and some community service stuff.  I'm vaguely involved in a few other things.  I'm fairly sure I want to pledge a fraternity next semester.  I love UVA.  It's great.  It's a great day to be alive.  If you're curious about anything, ask.

1	I don't know if I ever mentioned it here, but I've been wanting to start a band for ages, but I never actually did anything about it...  Yesterday my two friends and I decided we're gonna do it! All we need is someone who can play drums, heh. Because I can play the guitar and do the bass stuff, my friend can play the guitar too, and my other friend can sing. We spent friday and saturday rehearsing, here's our repertory so far:  Raul Seixas - Gita Like a Prayer - Madonna Papa Don't Preach - Madonna Ovelha Negra - Rita Lee Mania de Você - Rita Lee Everybody's Fool - Evanescence Another Brick in the Wall - Pink Floyd Smoke on the Water - Deep Purple Satisfation - Rolling Stones Sweet Child O'Mine - Guns N' Roses Wonderwall - Oasis Malandragem - Cássia Eller Que País É Esse - Legião Urbana Se - Djavan  *is super excited*
1	Im goin up north and Andy isnt comeing but i would of been hunting anyway i can get a deer with out himm bein there ok well im leavein in a few bye  -Drew-
0	That's it. I'm not helping people any more. You help people, they screw you over. You're nice to people, they treat you like crap. You give someone everything of yourself, and they take you for granted. You can do anything, even be paranoid to the point of insanity, and nothing ever changes and everything stays the same. All I ever wanted..... fuck it. No-one cares.
1	my mind's telling me "no", but my body-my body's telling me "yes".
1	My brother is moving!!!!!! That's not the yay.  He can't keep his cat!!!!!! Gettin' closer.  He doesn't want her to be out of the family, and he may want her back in a year if he moves again, so he asked me to take her. YAY!!!! Mitchell (yes, you read that right. She's a girl, and her name is "Mitchell". My brother is uckedfay.) is one of those cats that looks like her mommy smoked when she was pregnant and so she's fully grown but really teeny. I know I will probably get attached to her and giving her back will suck, but until then I will have her little kitty goodness all for myself. I am jazzed that right after Mitch Hedberg dies I get a cat named Mitchell. It's like my own furry little tribute.  Macy's gonna shit.
1	  SARA   TROUT   I   FREAKIN   LOVE   YOU   BABYCAKES!   HAPPY   BIRTHDAY!!!!  
1	I was bopped. ^-^ By a rather frightening and forboding person.   But I learned to bop back, rather quickly and appasrently I'm "getting somewhere" so. WHo knows! ^-^ I might try a bit harder!    &lt;3 Neil is lovely by the way. Did you know? 
0	sunday's over, it means my weekend rest is over too....too bad. i9 was just starting to enjoy a worry free day. i have to go back to school tomorrow. lots of things up. a quiz, a presentation, and an activity. it'll be sooooo tiring.   my sister, grace, just got back from cavite. she and my otehr sister fought over tv. and because of that, she decided to go back here. she said our otehr sister, ate mean, won't allow her to watch tv which i think is a bit shallow. neweyz, she said she's not going back there, ever. but just a few moments ago, she just said that after the vacation is through, she's going back to cavite. she keeps on changing her mind and i don't if i'll ever understand her.   i took an iq exam over the net which i accidentally stumbled upon. it said that i'm a facts curator and my iq is 133. is it good? i don't know eh.  ________________________________________   what was the last thing you ate?  ----- mangga and bagoong
1	         You Are a Martini             You're not a total lush, but you do like your drinks strong For you, drinking is an art. An experience to be relished. That doesn't mean you don't get really really drunk. A few strong martini's, and you're dancing on the bar!        What alcoholic drink are you?   
1	I feel great.  Had my last physio appointment today — got a group of "maintenance" exercises to ramp into, with the instruction to start living normally in a month or two.  Not that my modified life has been that much different... just if I wanted to sign up for something that requires shoulder strength, or, say... move from one apartment to another... then I can.  Had a nice Saturday Easter dinner with folks, cousins, cousins once removed and family friends... ate good food, watched kids be cute, talked.  Dinner on actual-Easter was a nice one with Elizabeth and Josh: golden-coin eggs, some wine sent up by my folks and cookies followed by games and talk.  I had a really nice time.  This week promises to be busy, and I feel up to it.
1	   Nothing much going on here just hanging out with my parentals.&nbsp; Love yall   
1	Monkeybottoms has made the funniest live journal icons   http://www.mrmonkeybottoms.com/live_jou rnal_icons.htm 
1	the banquet was way fun. Courtney won reporter of the year - yay! and David won photographer of the year for LV. I'm so proud of him! funny jokes were told. good food. it was great.  Wayne: Where do i even begin? Brandon: the 70's!  Shonrock: there's one award y'all don't know about. Brandon was voted most liekly to succeed by the Lubbock County Jail.  Brandon: Alright, who told Shonrock about me being in jail? Me and Matt: Brandon you're the one who made a joke about it at the beginning of the ceremony... Brandon: Damn.
1	life is good, nay, fantastic.  i am getting more and more involved, and i am LIVING. in about 4 minutes i will leave to go babysit for my psychology professor's twins. nik gave me his big old buick for the day. i went to black mountain's library and as i was driving back both bowie and skynyrd came on the same radio station, and i thought again how much i am this place and this place is me, the juxtaposition of country and city, hippies and pickup trucks with rebel flags on the back. i have a feeling that i'd love    santa cruz and i know i love london, but i can't see either speaking as clearly to my soul as this area does.
1	Mark i love you your the best...thanks for hooking up my pic and all.

1	   You Are Belle!        Intelligent and kind. Your beauty goes much further than your apperance. Also, you make judgements of people based on their personality and not their looks. Attaining all the knowledge that you can is one of your major goals in life, but you are also a person who can make things happen.     Which Disney Princess Are You?  
0	Spending New Year´s eve at home alone (there has to be a first time to everything, don´t you agree). Too many tragedies (read: deaths) have occured and I can´t get out of my house due to my panic disorder. Not to mention I don´t fucking want to get drunk tonight.  What the hey, I´m cooking pasta and crying my eyes out and if I didn´t know better I´d be just about to kill myself. Have a pleasant New Year everybody.
1	I know I haven’t updated recently and I can promise you this won’t be an update either; however, I just wanted to let everyone know that today, April 13, 2005, is Denise and I’s one year anniversary. And my, how far we have come since them!
1	Your life is worth way more than just some diamonds. Without bling I still gleam, glisten and shine, man.  -Akil of Jurassic 5  I've been in heavy rotation with Jurassic 5 in preparation for my first hip-hop conceert ever.  (I'm going to pretend that the 7th grade Vanilla Ice endeavor never happened.  Okay?  IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.)  These guys have a lot to say, and the melodic samples from NuMark and Cut Chemist are excellent.  I'm sure I'll shelf them for a while after the concert, or maybe the live show will make me want even more.  I really want to spend more time with The Roots'  Phrenology  and Linkin Park's  Meteora .  I'm also open to some suggestion if you are so inclined.  My musical taste goes much farther than hip-hop or rap-rock.  Try me and find out.
0	Jons house was super fun last night.  Shine thief was incredibly intense and every moment of it was fun fun fun.  Also it was cool chillen with the cruces kids.  And I think that possibly every single person's sexuality should be in serious question right now!  Also making the movies of me getting slapped was really funny but I think that I may have a headache related injury.  But wow was it funny.  Plus the amount of sleep I got was also quite amazing.  Anyway that was indeed a super duper fun night.  Is it bad that I was slightly aroused when I saw Jon in the panda panties??????  I don't think it is!!!  God that was teh funnies!  Now its back to my ho hum boring life.  God I wish that things would be eaiser sometimes.  But I guess it builds character.  Well fuck character!!!  That is all, why do I feel these entries are becoming more and more like Danny's.  Im suppose to be happy goddamit!!!
0	tonight is pennylane's last show for a long while!! how am i going to use all my excess energy?? come back penny.... come back penny's sister....
1	Today is the first day in about two weeks I don't feel sick! I am so happy! I can actually do things!! I got a nose bleed again last night though. I was starting to get really scared, but today I feel just fine. So yeah, today is a good day! Well, save the fact that I had the stupidest/weirdest/scariest dream last night, but whatever.  ~Aiko  P.S. YAY!
1	I learnt today that I am one of the elite few who don't know the concept of life, or in other words I live life to the fullest. I will write more when my parents go to sleep and I can go on without getting in trouble.  Sorry Larri about the mishap. Never happen again.
1	Happy birthday to Kosta and Alexis!!  Two friends same bday...kinda creepy...CREEPY I SAY!!!!  hehe may your bday wishes come true ^_^
0	my lunch date canceled and i didn't bring a lunch. :(
1	          Eternal thanks to Kelly for making this gif from the Holy Grail.  The legend of the Cler was true after all.  And thanks to Clay for doing this for me.  Especially the bra. 
1	Well I guess this actually started on sunday. My Grandma has been checking the sunday want adds for me since I've been unemployed. On sunday she called me with that days listings and there was one that got my attention. It tuned out to be a recrutment for Federal Civil Service and a pitch for a compay's program to prepair you for the civil service exam. After the lecture I was probably 90% excited and 10% scared, or maybe the other way around. I have been wanting to get into civil service for sometime now but wasn't sure where to start. I decided to pay for the program. So withing the next 8 weeks or so I will be going through that at about 4 hours a day. I also found out today that this program also get me a couple of certificates. On being forensics and I can't remember the other. Also it gets me a wepons permit. I'm still excited. I have yet to decide what field I'm going to go into but I do have a couple of ideas. Well wish me luck :-) And I will give updates on how it is going.
1	Haven't had time to post since the concert, and so begins my report.  Flogging Molly was the coolest.  Seeing nutty old Nick, crazy Kellie and..uh..crap, I can't think of an alliteration for Becca...Guess I'll go with bodacious...Yeah...Anyway, I drove down there with Jon and Sam and bought a ticket for Frankie who came later and had to park on the other side of the world.  Crikey, that band can get a group of people moving.  It stank horribly down in the pit, but the music was simply grand.  Other than that, I've been doing a lot of stoopid architecture homework, but this project's almost due so therefore almost done.  I can't wait.  Oh yeah, Hey Jon, "'Nigga, what about your wife?'  'Nigga, fuck my wife.  I'm trying to save my mutha fuckin' life.'"  Ahaahahhahahahahahahahah
1	i get my 87' crown vic tomorrow...yoohoo      PROM FASHION SHOW TONIGHT BABY!! yay gilmore..KILL THEM BUTTERFLIES!! YOURE GUNNA KICK ASS!!!
0	Off to the OU nice and early this morning am I, I'm into work with my Dad to hopefully meet Stephanie, a French student, who has offered to help me on my french!  I woke up ages ago and was lying in bed thinking 'why hasn't my Dad tried to wake me up yet?' I go down stairs to find it's 6:45. Typical me, I have to stop rubbing my eyes, but it's difficult as they are watering so much, silly things. I better actually get dressed soon, I've got an hour, and my computer must be packed away, because I can connect it to the network at the OU! Yay!  I cooked a good breakfast, I'm not sure what to wear exactly, I'm going to go and see if H still has that hair clip that I want to use, but no, she took it to Italy! My own fault I suppose for asking her to give it back and not getting round to taking it. I'm going to get out of not knowing not to wear and just wear my green jumper.
1	I have Unreal Tournament 2004 now. :D :D :D  I haven't installed it yet, though. First I'm reading the manual. ^_^  I also got Tsunami Bomb's  Invasion From Within  CD. I am a happy Talec. ^____^
1	only 60 more minutes of this awful job. DAMN THIS FEELS GREAT!!!
1	Just got back from East Lansing and everthing went pretty good with my sister.  Definately way better than expected.  Damn, being in the middle is a really shitty place to be.  Thanks Melissa for all the help and advice, it's really nice to have an outside perspective sometimes. We went bowling, it was my first time in about 2 1/2 months.  I sucked at first, the first 8 out of 10 throws were gutters which is highly unlike me.  But I came around, my scores were 73, 123, 142, 179.  It was nice to see the 179. I just started checking any type of concert coming to this area to see if there's one good to go to.  I so forgot how much shit there is to do around here.  I just found concerts for BNL, Third Eye Blind, Godsmack, Chris Rock and ICP (which I really wouldn't want to see but you can hope that that's the concert where the release their last CD, lol). Well, Time to go out and smoke.
1	Top executive one day.....I'm at Sarah's house! Woot!  - Jimmy  j + S = Awesomeness
1	So finally today I have been able to confirm that next week at this time I am definitely going to be in Las Vegas at  defcon  w/ the Douglas, BP, etc... which should rock something fierce. I have also found out about  Queercon  which though might be a little/very sketchy should be interesting to drop by and see what is up.   In other news I received my  EFF  membership letter + sticker in the mail today, which I signed up for at HOPE a few weeks ago, though the nice woman promised me a shirt w/ my registration, I am pretty sure she was full of it. But no matter it was a worthwhile thing to do regardless of the t-shirt.  Other than that it is time once again for me to move out to my father's house for the remainder of the summer, which should not be too bad. Though the place is out in the country and it can get mighty lonely out there, but as Gloria Gainor said "I will survive". Off to packing!

0	Caused my gf's daughter's parakeet to perish.  This weekend the girls were over and had brought their "pocket pets" with them.  Archimedes was a little parakeet we had gotten her for Yule.  When we left Saturday for the park we had not realized that Brim, our cat, was locked in their bedroom with the birds.  Unfortunatley he didn't fare well on this encounter with Brim.  The bird was hurt, and we didn't realize how bad until the next day when she called from the road trip back to WV that he had died.  I felt so bad for the little one.  He had a lot of spunk and was an awesome little parakeet.  We will miss him.
1	hehehe...iba na to...ewan...masaya lang ako ngayon...ewan ko ba bakit...hmm.. ang daming nagbabakasyon at nagouting ngayon..ako stuck dito sa bahay.. sa bagay pahinga kasi ang tagal ko ring nawala..hehehe  kachat ko ngayon ung mga taong namiss ko! hahaha...hmm..ang pasaway kong bata nagiinternet ako ngayon e inuutusan ako ng mommy ko..hehe...  cge na nga..mamaya na...wala naman akong masabi e..
1	Live at the Horn. Oh My God.  Last night was the best night of my life. It was absolutely amazing. I don't even know where to start. So many talented people, so many awesome bands...there are no words. Thats about all I can say right now.
0	Remember the asshole I've mentioned a few times?  He moved far away. Actually, like 2 hours. But still, that means no having him drop by the school to torture me even after he has graduated.   We talk online now. He was being really nice. I was thinking about how much better he behaves now that he's far. That's what this post was going to be about until five minutes ago.   Thanks for the insults, man. You still suck.
1	I'm playing at Nation tonight for the first time since like... fall 2002.  This is cool.  Additionally is my first gig since October.  I'm so excited I could spit.  *spit*  Yeah, that about did it.  Anticipation!!
0	Buh.  School sucks ass.  I'll be done with classes on Friday which is two weeks or so before non-seniors are.  So that means most of my professors have decided to pile work up on me.  I'd rather just graduate two weeks later while they sort grades/comps/n' shit out.  But no go!  My senior project sucks.  I think I'm going to change it to a much easier and much less stressful unit plan.  But now the Pug might have a neurological disorder that could paralyze her.  She's been walking funny for the past two weeks.  The vet is going to take X-rays or something to just see if it was a problem with her hips.  But eh... I'm not trying to think about it too much.  I just &lt;3 my pug.
1	Finally pictures online. Go to:   http://lynette-paterson.fotopic.net/c42 0203.html   I will get all the pictures have of Livie on her eventually - but there are rather alot!
0	life was fun for one day. then i was knocked back into reality. dammit.
0	umm hello....today was fine.  after school i watched an episode of the o.c. and then went to the portrait gallery to inquire about senior pictures...i think i might be a rep there so if you are thinking of getting pictures there come to me and i'll get ya 60 free wallets....yea....sweet deal.  then i went to uptown styling and signed up to tan for a while for prom....my god do a lot of people tan there...my appointment tomorrow is at 9:20 at night...kinda ridiculous, but oh well...it was pretty cheap.  and i'm gettin my haircut tomorrow after school there so that'll be fun.  and when i got home tonight i watched the o.c. the rest of the night and i finished up by crying a lot when anna left to go back to pittsburgh....i kind of balled my eyes out...pitifull....just a bit...oh well  i do love it
1	I didn't work all weekend! wow it was hot! I start my new job tomarrow at modern, I'm excited! I ofcourse spent most of the weekend with nick which is the best way to spend my free time really! lol I'm so girly some times. I cut my hair tonight its not that diff but a little. I like it, and I'm going to buy dye tomarrow. What color good ol' red again, should i bleach it? bust a punky color on it like vergin red? ot Vamp's blood... hhmmmmm? what to do? I think that ever i do if its not blonde, I will do blonde highlights(chunky). Well washin clothes and thinking about tomarrow!
1	Good weather is finally here, and to celebrate, I am breaking out the smoker tommorow and making some ribs. Since I have been very disapointed in all the BBQ ribs I have ordered in restaurants lately, I am really looking forward to this.
0	eh its sunday and im  kinda dissapointed about yesterday cuse me and lexi were supposed to  the moovies but she didnt text me so i guess that she was real busy so i said to my self  eh fuck it so i gave my sisters's boyfriend 50 dollars and i told him to take my sis out to a dinner and a moovie since i couldnt go i might as well make it fun for my sis and her bf  so i felt happy about that and also while i was home i did the usual play ddr play guitar and sit and whatch tv yesh another boooring day and now im at work updating on these uber-fast computers and imma be here all day       i hate work!    end.   jesse
1	met my love. Claire. didnt mind that we didnt actually do much in the ten days that I was there, because I was with her... but we saw movies, got drunk, i met her friends, and so on. i dont really know what to say....it was great. umm... Claire is happiness. her brothers think I'm cool. thats probably just because I gave them Redskins though. and I think i get along wth her parents. not being with her hurts a bit, but we know we love each other... haha....there's eskimo kisses where you rub noses, and butterfly kisses where you feel their eyelashes on you as they blink. but we made up a new one. the "we met over the internet" kiss, where our glasses click together as we kiss. so dorky. and yet i dont care. and other than that, words elude me as to how i feel about my little vacation to meet the love of my life.
1	Yea, so it looks like most of the people can make it for Friday. I'm thinking around 6:30 would be best (pleanty of time to make all the food). You don't have to bring a thing, but if you would like something in specific, let me know. I prolly won't make much turkey, considering the real Thanksgiving is the day before. Umm... I think that's about it.
1	Last night I went for a walk around campus. While I was walking God impressed upon my heart how cool it would be to see this entire campus on fire for Jesus. How awesome would that be? To see that many young people ready to got out for Him. I can hardly imagine the impact they would have going out into the world.  I'm expecting this to happen one day. I don't even have words to express the joy this gives me.  God is good.   Lord, don't let me burn out on the way, as I wait expectantly for You to do this.
1	Ok, so I lost an ass-load of money this weekend, but the good news is,       dcontaminant    and       k_totem    are coming down from the twin cities, so everything's going to be great.  We'll all be going out to Inferno tonight, perhaps stopping by the 'dise if I can talk them into it.  Woohoo!  Yay for good friends!
1	about to leave to go see some bands at the ridge and uhh you should too  
1	do yourself a favor, watch the trailer for Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith.  It is fucking awesome!!!
0	Why cant i take it back, Why can't i say what i mean, The words are hard, They dont come out right, I need help, But noone can help, I want to take back, Everything that ive done, Forget i ever did it, It makes me sad to remeber, The blood down my arm, The feelings of love, I lost, The razor on my skin, But it'll never go back, NEVER.
0	Right now i am at chriss house so i am not as bored but i do need to do lots of homework 4 mr olson . *sigh* i am so bored i really would like to tlak to some one. alex becca or richele.please call.
0	In the dark despair that has been my life the last few days..and I am sure will continue into the rest of my life..a small...teeny...glimmer of something             I was soooooo crying all night long at work last night. They sent me home. The closer it gets to Saturday the more my stomach gets all icky. I really REALLY don't want to see him. But I am going to have. but that don't mean I will have to talk to him.  Gotta clean.  ~Alie
1	Last night was Queens of the Stone Age.  As was to be expected, it rocked my fucking face off.  I just wish I'd have brought one of these with me...     I would have filled the whole damn card.  BIG BIG WEEKEND AND VACATION COMING UP!!!
1	I"M SOOO FREAKIN HAPPY! haha and i have no clue why... maybe b/c i got 8 hrs of sleep! or because the suns out or because sara wasn't sad this morning, or because a bunny hit me in the eye to wake me up, or because i'm listening to such good summer music and i just ate a lemon yogurt (my favooorriiittee).  i'm soo happy i just wanna sit here and smile and giggle all day but people would think i was a little loopy. haha oh well.
1	Ahh I saw the poster for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.. and I REALLY HAVE TO SEE THAT MOVIE!! I mean, it's Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.. you just can't go wrong!       It really looks amazing!! I love the "font" Tim Burton uses for the movie titles.. it's always a bit similar.. for example if you compare Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas and now this movie.. :D The only bad thing about it is that I have to wait until July 2005 to see it! And I have a feeling it will come out much later in Finland. Oh well, it shall be worth the wait! :DD
0	so it hit me. we've been packing all day, alexis just left, and my mom said, "don't worry, you 2 will both have fun," the knot started forming, and it was all over. i think a gallon was let out. so we're actually leaving. it's like the whole time i didn't actually think it was going to happen, and now it is. she means so much to me it's unreal. i can't believe how lucky i am.
0	i go out walking, after midnight out in the moonlight, just like we used to do im always walking, after midnght searching for you...  i walk for miles, along the highway well thats just my way, of saying i love you im always walking, after midnight searching for you...  i stop to see a weeping willow crying on his pillow maybe he's crying for me and as the skies turn gloomy night winds wisper to me im lonesome as i can be  i go out walking, after midnight out in the starlight, just hoping you may be somewhere im walking, after midnight searching for you...   i feel like this song expresses my feelings alot. i literally go from place to place lately with the hope that ill meet some great gal or something. being lonely sucks but what can i do about it... ill just go out for a walk, i think.   after tonight is a full moon... perhaps ill meet somebody.
1	I was just brushing my teeth and for some reason instead of spitting in the sink I just spat all over my carpet... wtf.   That is all.
1	Luckiest guy alive...great weekend with Vanessa and her parents, all so accepting and nice and caring.  And you are one of a kind!!!!  :-D  Bellows, tell your aide to die next time he/she bitches at you to get in bed.  And Donno, Manny's email reminded me of you.
0	Arthur Miller died today.    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6953165/?GT 1=6190   With theatre not being as good as it used to, its sad to have one less GOOD playwright alive.  Now, along with Elia Kazan, who died almost two years ago, they can reunite and make good Theatre productions wherever it is they are now.  I think i'll re-read Death of a Salesman now.   In me news, nothing new. Still here, waiting for the weekend.
0	it's funny ... but it's not, really ...  i go to work every night, and i am a focused, productive person. I don't have issues, i don't have personal problems, i have a job to do and i do it well and (generally) without emotion.   But when i leave, I'm fighting back tears before i even reach the freeway. If there's nothing to distract me, nothing else to focus on, it all goes back to the same subject.   i've never felt so completely empty before ... like anything i do doesn't matter, because i'm doing it alone, and what do i care if i can't share it with anyone? i hate that i'm acting like a co-dependent girl, that's not how i am, or maybe not how i was. it's not "anyone", though ... it's him. and no one before had an effect on me like he did.

0	I am not going into controversial statements here about impending war and the such, but I just had to say that our department alone has had four reserves called into active duty. 1 is a desktop technician, 1 is a network engineer, 1 is a web services specialist and one is my coworker who is the same thing as me. Two have been called into active duty for at least a year, and two have been called into active duty for at least six months.  These are these people's daytime jobs and has nothing to do with what they may or maynot do in their particular branches of the reserves.  One of them came up to me and quietly said "I don't want to go."

1	Last week was non eventful. My friend Fiona's baby Samantha had to go into hospital to get her hip popped into place as she was born with 2 dislocated hips. After she was born, the doctors put her in a removable plastic splint which has helped one side but the other hasn't changed. So the wee tot spent 3 days in hospital getting a solid plaster cast put on which she'll have for the next 3 months So as a result Fiona was left feeling a little low, and they came round for their tea so I could spoil Samantha (without Olivia noticing) and they could get a rest.   Went through to Hatton at the weekend to see my chum Susan who at last joined the 30s club - now she knows how I feel - especially as her wedding is in 6 weeks. About time too - she's been engaged for the last 10 years.  Had my sister & her fiance round on Sunday for a bbq as the weather was fantastic for a change. In fact the weather was that good Willie *finally* painted the fence :)

1	    HAPPY BIRTHDAY RACHEL!!!!!!      Now everyone else, go and wish my bestest a super happy 16th birthday cuz I said so!
1	Made for my brother. He had an amusing mental image of Denethor glaring pointedly into the distance whilst flicking open a Zippo lighter, and occasionally absent-mindedly passing his fingers through the flame. It's one of those things that looks better acted out than written down *g* Anyway, a five minute sketch and some fiddling with Photoshop/Imageready produced this:        
1	In just the past couple of days my life has made a total complete turn.  It's freakin sweet.  Mark and I got engaged, our parents are cool with it. We're talking about moving in together realllly soon. I just don't know exactly when.  Katie J had her baby day before yesterday, he's soo cute.  Both of them are doin just fine.  It's soo sweet.  I have gotten back in touch with friends from high school.  It's amazing what can happen after a couple years.  I love it. Really I do.  Well I must hop off to class.
1	Landed the 3rd skirt!!  ::trying to do a happy dance and not cough my brains out::  Now all I'll need are frilly ankle socks and a white Oxford shirt...  Me..with frilly ankle socks...  That just sounds so  wrong  coming from me...

1	Megaman X: Command Mission... KICKS ASS!  X is so pretty~
1	I just found this place, and became immediately brightened by the fact that it exists.  I was thinking earlier this morning about the sad ratio of girl to guy gamers, and looking for some reassurance that we do exist.    I'm a 20 year old from Grand Valley State University.  My name is Brooke (or Arden), and I've been gaming for 4 years now or something.  I'm a player and a GM, for primarily D20 systems, but occasionally something a little more wild and crazy.  (Ok, maybe not.  Maybe just Hackmaster.)  I'm involved with my campus gaming organization, and we're planning an April gaming con, so heck, if you're in the area of western Michigan, I'll be sure to let you all know around that time, so you can plan on coming, because it'll be wonderful.  Oh, and I &lt;3 KoDT.    Looking forward to meeting you all.

0	  Hello. today i realized how far gone i really am. there is no way out now. and i think that i might actually be okay with it. really i am. i love when my parents decide to take day trips which put me in a car with nothing to think about but what is in my mind. so i though. i'm so confused with my emotions right now. thats when i realized that i really was that far gone. there is no going back now. nothing that can stop me. i'm just going to be stuck on this path i'm heading down forever. but there is almost a comfort in knowing that....       I am starting to really get into photography now. i went to brooks and bought black and white film for my mommys old 35 mm camera. then we stopped in this old graveyard in mass. and i took almost a whole role of film of picture. i will try to post them soon. farewell.....      *HER Evil Royalty*          
1	Well, this is the end of 2003 :S I don't want to go into 2004, I am absolutely terrified, etc, etc, I've plagued you all with it enough.  I am off to see Pan a third time this morning, with my Mum B-) Ahaha, I am so excited. I am more excited about seeing Pan a third time than I was about seeing RotK the first.   BAFFLE. In less than a week. BAFFLE. (Y) (Baffle is this place, that isn't really a town because there are no shops or schools or anything. Just beach houses. Only, not really beach, because there's no beach. But there is Baffle Creek which looks, smells and feels like a beach. Salt water, sand, fish, and all that jazz. Except waves. No waves :)) ANYWAY, Kathynessmelme go up there for a week every year and live together and cook all our own meals and fight over what we're listening to and ourloveissodomestic)  I will more than likely do that 2003 meme when I get home from Pan this morning.   Happy New Year's Eve guys. (Y)
1	That friend of mine I was talking about before is luckily still fine. Well not fine, since they did break up, but he's still alive and breathing. I'm so relieved. :D   And I managed to copy the files from a friend of mine he wanted to give me, but which couldn't copied at first but now it worked and now I'm confusing myself. Lol. It's really good because I've been looking for these files for centuries ^_^ *bounces*
1	I had my hair done today.  Trim, dye and she was nice enough to flat iron it.  ^-^  After that I went to the comic book shop across the street and I bought the second book to Sin City.  God its awesome!  I love it!  Can't wait to see the movie!  ^^
1	So everything seems to be going perfect for once and you shall be hearing no compliments from me on that issue.  The only thing is the surprise I had for Dana is going to come full circle soon.  I figured we should get our own apartment.  I mean I was planning on doing that before the accident and I figured it would give Celine back her place so why not.  Plus, I would living with the woman I love so all would be well also.  Thing is part of it scares me to death because it's a big step and the other part of me is extremely excited about it.  I hope Dana likes the new apartment.  I mean it's on the boardwalk still and it's not that far from Celine in the long run so all in all I think things are going to work out just fine.
0	Hey All. I'm over at Stacy's house and she was checkin out her livejournal.. so I thought I would update mine! Woo. Yesterday was the last day of school! I'm so sad. I'm gonna miss so many people! This year went by way to fast.. Everyone thats going to South.. We gotta keep in touch! I'll never forget any of you, remember that. Wow.. Its so weird.. Doesn't seem like school is out. I'm gonna miss all of your teachers.. They were the best! Today Saoirse and I went to school and said bye to some teacher. It was so sad.. Mr. Miller was even sad.. Of all of you that don't know. Mr. Miller won't be a teacher at Sanford anymore, or a very little chance he will.. If you wanna know more about it ask me. Anywayz.. I gotta go meet Ava up at Longfellow to play some Volleyball. I'll update again sometime.
0	Gene and Jess are moving tomorrow. It's not fair,I lose two of my best friends AND I'm stuck with Amy and Richard for another two months. YUCK. Well at least it's more time for my parents to get their house ready for us. I hope I can find a full time job in the shithole area soon. I want my own place soo bad...That and I think my dad's going to flip because I left Wal-Mart after a fun night of below zero and not being able to push carts through frozen slush.

Getting it dyed darker and THEN getting highlights! Yes Kristin is clever.  Four more days...
1	Hello everyone.  Just joined this community since it looked the most active.  The few others i found didnt even have posts this year yet!  So here i am.  I was an instant fan the first time i saw the "Reasons Why" video on CMT.  They had thier own unique sound that i fell in love with from only hearing one song.  Part of that love was placed in Saras beautiful voice.  She could sing unlike the next Britney or Christina that fell out of the pop assembly line.  And i think Sara has a natural beauty that makes her prettier than any of those teen pop queens hands down.  Anyway, im just here.  If you want to chat just let me know.  I enjoy meeting new people.  :)

1	In late December of 2003, I had an idea for a  Peter Pan  fanvid set to Outkast's "Hey Ya!"  And now that everyone is over "Hey Ya!" I have  finally  done it.  This is my first attempt at a fanvid and let me say, it's no "She Bangs" (which of course is the best HP fanvid of all time).  But damn, it feels good to be a vidder.      Hey Ya!     A 10.1 mb dream come true.  Right click + save.    Also, if you - like Miss Applebaum,       marvolo   , and me - love you some  Veronica Mars , I wrote a naughty little Logan/Veronica ficlet.  It's  here .  I'm sure I'll put it on Paper Moon eventually.

0	the sickness of love and the sickness of hate the same feeling for both but a different reaction for each.  I loved you I loved everythign about you I loved how we were together I loved how you made me feel  I hate you now I hate how you won't tell the truth I hate how you push me aside I hate how you ignore what I say  I love how you helped me I love how you cared I love your touch and feel I love you still.  the pain you've given me pushed me to the brink the pain that tore my heart into millions of pieces the pain that lingers into my soul the pain that I can beat   when you told me I was beautiful I thought you were too when you said I was great, I thought you were too when you told me you hated being without me, I hated being apart from you  when you told me you loved me, I loved you too in fact I still love you and always will.
1	Strange how feeling good on the inside makes you feel better on the outside too. For the first time in a long time, I truely feel really good.   :)  Hope everyone else is doin' cool.
0	i am making my friend easter baskets. tomorrow will be fun. i stretched my ears to 00 g. it was a proud moment. shouldn't there be pain?  i was told by another person today that i like being sad. does anyone really like to be sad? just because one is all the time doesn't mean that they enjoy it unless they purposly do things that would conflict with their happiness on purpose.

1	I absolutely love children's theater.  Some girl came up to Jen and said in a very formal manner "May i take you chicken?"..."I want to bring your chicken home so i can show my mom.  The person that is the chicken is very good at acting like a chicken."  heehee.  Today we had a lot more kids than Monday and three rows of kids there.

1	 http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/feat ures/hitchhikersguide/exclusive.asp   Whooh!   *bounces around*   This little trailer made my day, and also that of half my classmates. We watched the two freshly released trailers today more then we actually did anything useful. ;)   I mean, this trailer is practically a satirical masterpiece on it's own right setting exactly the right tone we love so much of the books. Just the trailer voiceover bit or lines like  "The goal is to create a piece of advertising that is provocative but original and exciting. It's intelligent and provocative, in other words: lot's of things blowing up." XD  Oh damn, I want to run to the theatre just to see the trailer on the big screen. ;)  Oh well, anyway... I have some pressing business to attend to.
1	Chance of thundershowers today! I haven't seen those in forever! Party time, Julie-Kate!    Bring on the rain!  
1	So...went out so Edd could have a lesson on Joe today. After all was said and done, I got to get on him. God. like I said the other night. My spirit is still flying from the ride. it was no where near perfect, but yea. I feel better. It's weird. I mean I love my Jack, and Robin, but Joe..well I've done everything with Joe up until this point. Sure I've had some help along the way, but I've pretty much done it all..and now the fact that we are riding him..well..its like he's all grown up. Having dealt with his illnesses, and everything else that we've had to deal with, it's almost a miracle he's actually being ridden..hell that he's still alive. I'm a proud parent. I know if I go through this again with another horse it'll be the somewhat the same, but at the same time it won't. Joe, he's special. The day he leaves this world I'll cry so hard. I'm really looking forward to SUnday. really really.
0	Today we have our first rugby home game and were going to get crushed. Meh, on tuesday we had our first game of the season and the other team didn't know how to play and they took out Freedman but we took out two of their three subs so it was all good. After the game we wanted to kill the other team but ya it was ok it was a tie 0-0. The whole team was going to kill them, and we should have. -Char
0	i feel like i have spent too much of my life while i was growing up trying to run away from my parents and get out of the house, never really stopping to realize what truly wonderful people they are.  thankfully now the past few years i have been able to spend more time with them when i am home, and when they come to visit me, i treasure it so much when i do get to see them... i love you both mom and dad
1	got my story "song for stanley" published in the sandy river review.  just got a copy from aaron today--a week before they hit the stands, teehee. school's going swell so far.  i've now had all of my credit classes.  journalism should be the biggest challenge this year.  i'm really looking forward to my women's studies, human sexuality, and poetry classes.  now time to do homework and buy books!  yuck! :)
0	Someone give me an answer ... b/c it hurts to much to think any more.
1	Well I am just trying to get something done around here.  Although being nervous and excited about seeing Harry again keeps me thinking about how things will go, but I am not expecting anything from him or myself.
1	Woo Hoo!  Kev's here for two weeks...and then I head out to RIT for my Spring Break.  Today we agreed that it's official so Sami has a boyfriend yayness!  Having fun so far, though this week is uber busy.  Praying for the MSM 118 group project to run smoothly on Wednesday.  Then I get to vent my anger and frustrations out during hockey Wednesday night.  Speaking of hockey, I scored a goal Sunday night and Kev missed it cuz he stepped out...*stares back at him and growls*  but he got to see me beat up guys with checks.  Someone's stick grazed my ear when we got tied up against the boards, so I'm just glad my ear is okay.  Well, playing Super Smash Bros. Melee with Kev and Andre so  Love, Peace, and Chicken Grease !
0	Alright, I've calmed down a little bit.  I won't go into why I was mad at this guy, but lets just say it was a first impression he DIDN'T want to make.  The after effects of me getting angry at him are settling in though.  Someone I never want to get mad at me is mad at me for not giving him more of a chance than I did.  I don't know...maybe I didn't give him enough of one.  I didn't even say hi to the guy...but I don't think it would have mattered.  He insulted everything I did say.  But the person that's mad at me...I REALLY do not want them mad at me.  Not now, not ever.  I don't even know why I'm writing this right now.  They know I set this up, but I don't think they've gone to look at it or noticed that I've even made any updates.
1	hey, i'm a new member. as you can tell by my username, i'm a big fan of the secret garden. i just want to make a request to all you icon makers out there to PLEASE MAKE MORE TSG icons, especially ones of mary. there are us fans out here who really want them. thanks :)

Love to all I haven't talked to in ages - extra YAAAAAAYs in particular for Currykins' long-awaited green card!
0	have you ever had that feeling that sometimes things happen a little to late. Like if they had happened when they were suppose to everything would have been ok, but it didn't. I guess the whole, "wrong timing" thing. *sigh*, I think i've reached that point, and as much as i want to not feel that way, it seems to be...What do you do when you reach that point?  Tiffany
0	Pepe ran away today. He's been gone since 2pm. My dad left the door open and he ran out. I hope he comes back.
0	This is what sucks about having a job:  Lisa Marie Presley is going to be in Memphis (at the Beale Street Music Festival) on the Sunday after I see Gavin and Tolch at the very same festival. She'll be in Nashville the following Monday. What am I doing both of those days? Working my ass off.   Fuck.  Oh well. I can't afford a two day pass to the festival anyway.
1	For almost a week i sat in my dorm feeling sorry for myself.. whining and complaining about how once again i had been dicked over.  When i finally stopped my selfishness things turned and changed right before my eyes.  I never even saw it coming.  This time three weeks ago, i never thought i would be as happy as i am right now.  Fate works in weird ways...
1	woohoo I got my star wars trilogy dvds today.    can't wait to watch them again. hehehe. its my all time favorite movies.
1	so how was everybody's valentines day???? mine was good for once-my mom came to visit me and brought me cards and a rose and some candy, then i watched the notebook with sarah and jason, then i went to ryans house, and he got me a beta fish!!!! im excited bc ive been wanting one of those!! then we drank and made cds and got taco bell. nothing special but fun! anyway , i cant wait for next week, i won pistons tickets from work and its on tuesday! im so excited.  anyways i have nothing to write in here really but i was just bored

1	last night was so much fun. 2 pairs of shoes+louisa+dancing to rap+giant cookie+bad smelling perfume spray= a very funny time. &lt;3  so tonight i saw into the woods, a musical at school. it was pretty good. i was impressed. our school has alot of talent. tomorrow i think im going to a show at the temple with joshua.   hope everyone is doing well.
1	What an interesting half-day...I feel relaxed, and for the first time in...about a week, I feel secure....It's nice...^-^
1	yay!!!! it's friday and i can actually say that this weekend will actually be a real weekend for me!!! not only that but it will be a  3 DAY WEEKEND!!!  now i just have to make it till 5pm this afternoon. maybe he'll let us out early since it is friday. sitting in a classroom for 10 hours with very boring material is really bad. not only that but we have "toy" m16's and we have to take them EVERYWHERE WE GO. it's not to be an ass. it's to teach us not to walk away from our weapon when we actually get on shift.   anyway...must get off here and finish getting ready.

1	          My pirate name is:               Iron Anne Flint                   A pirate's life isn't easy; it takes a tough person. That's okay with you, though, since you a tough person. Like the rock flint, you're hard and sharp. But, also like flint, you're easily chipped, and sparky.    Arr!          Get your own pirate name from fidius.org.     
1	Maybe this'll be fun.  Post a comment with a memory of me. It can be anything you want. Then post this in your journal. See what people remember about you.
1	I know it's been forever since I wrote but I'm finally getting motivated. My trip to michigan was decent at best and I'm really glad to be home : ) I'm in a really good mood! Everything is just going too perfectly right now. It's still kind of worrying me b/c things don't usually go this well for me. But I've decided to stop worrying about it and just enjoy whatever comes. Man, I hope no one reads this cuz my journal's really boring.
1	yee-haw!  music camp rocked.  new people who are fun, new experiences (first college party!  i know, i'm a junior.  :-P) which were fun, new place to live (yayayay!).  so yay!  oops!  and people are now here so i gotta go.  more later! ~J!
1	Kristi: I asked her if she knew you, and she was like "Sam W******* is like famous." HAH.  my dad just bought me a first edition concert bag. lamb print. L.A.M.B. IS MY CRAAAAACK. i'm sooo excited cause it's the guitar straps and ::dies:: i can't have it until my birthday though :(  ummm. thats it!
1	I moved out of my Mom's house and in with my step-mum.  She lives near my college and I'm having so much fun living here.  My step-niece is usually around (she's almost 2 years old, we babysit her when her mom is working) and my step-brother and his girlfriend who live here with us are expecting their first child in November.  I'm down the road from a mini mall so I can get a job and college is about 15 miles down the road in the other direction.  But seeing as there's no job right now, I can write stories and make Marigold very happy :)
1	WOOHOO!!!&nbsp; New Monitor.  it's huge, taes up almost my whole des, but, whatever, it wor, and it's shiny (for now) and I shall enjoy it.&nbsp; hmm, there's a button on this eyboard that doesn't wor though.&nbsp; can you guess what it is?
1	Went to H&R Block today.  I was there about three minutes - just long enough for the guy to tell me that I had done everything right.    Unbelievable.  He didn't even charge me, and it turns out I don't have to pay New York City taxes.  So I went shopping. :-)
1	Bought a brush pen plus refill today for 5.15 Euro. Yes, Copic. So I guess the girl behind the counter rang it up wrong, because the pen alone is supposed to cost 7.95 Euro. Or maybe the guy in the store shouted the wrong price. Either way I'm not complaining...  Expect me to use it. D: (a.k.a. new stuff on the way, hopefully soon)
1	No school for me today. Woo!!! I exempted ICA which I know is easy but I had to get away from this guy who I am pretty sure liked me. I know running away from those sort of things is not the wisest thing to do but I am so clueless when it comes to relationships. *Sighs* So I am just sitting her at home being somewhat bored. Tomorrow is graduation so I am going to be bored out of my mind just sitting there. But I'll probably just bring a book or write something. Hehehe. I figured out what the numbers meant on Another Side, Another Story: Deep Dive. I knew that it was significant that the numbers started at 13. Turns out the whole thing is a map. Gosh. Kingdom Hearts Two is getting more complex and weird the more they send out information. But I love it. Lol.

1	Hey guys so im doing pretty good right now.   I feel really happy, and content about everything.  So really i have nothing to talk about. I went to Beauty and the Beast at Derryfield i was wicked impressed. It was wicked good for a school show. The whole thing was really good. Lumiere was wicked good. Tyree and Chris and Jake were GREAT! Jenna Bee or if it is Jenna B whatever it is you sounded SOOO GOOOD. You were so great. so yea it was fun i hung out with some of my fav people Melanie Andrea and Andrew.   Snow is kinda on my bad side right now.    Random quote of the day "You take this and fill it up with your favorite fruit juice!"  Im out  Sincerely. Jake
1	So yah, I'm enjoying my last couple free days until I start grad school.  I went to the school orientation and decided it was a complete waste of time.  On the other hand, I went to the grad orientation for the history department... and oh my goodness.  So much stuff to do and remember and to go to.  I have to do bi-weekly meetings with my mentor (although she's a really cool professor that wrote one of my college recommendations).  In addition to this, I have seminars every thursday that range from a tour of the library, to how to write well, to learning different techniques for teaching classes.  But overall I'm really looking forwards to being back in school and only having to study what I really want to.  No more stupid philosophy courses that I really don't want to take (ahem, existentialism).  Anyways, yah, I'll update you all more when I've actually started doing something.
0	*sigh*  As high as my hopes were for yesterday, NOTHING went right.  I went Xmas shopping, didn't get nearly as much as I'd hoped, forgot all the presents for my family (just got stuff for Niles and my Secret Santa at work), and did NOT get to the art store.  The reason for that being, the art store is in the shopping center of a college town, and it was the next-to-last Saturday before Christmas.  NO WAY am I gonna even TRY to handle all that traffic, escecially since half the streets in that corner of town are one-way (very confusing) and the parking consists of very small universal lots and a lot of parallel parking along the streets.  No.  Not in Xmas shopping season.  Not me.  Nuh uh.  So...  I'm gonna try to work with the half-dead marker I have and see how it goes.  Probably will be slow going.  Wish me luck.

0	You all should know by now that I try not to curse on my journal because I think it takes away from the point. But   this: fucking sucks. I guess also in the same vein is that Terri died, but I really don't care about that.  Edit:   Also, Johnny Cochrine(spelling's off...the guy who got OJ off) died too.  Double Edit:   Another person is about to die...For all the Catholics, the Pope had his last rights read to him.  Later.
1	I am in such a happy, good mood. It's probably due to me having to not work tomorrow. In about an hour I am going over to Kelly's. She got a computer (her friends mum gave it to her as it's not used anymore), so Kelly wants me to install some things for her as she doesn't know how to do it. I love computers so much, I'd love to get a job one day working with computers, so I will enjoy sorting it out for her. I am planning to tidy my hard drive sometime this week and it is so messy!! I hope I do tidy it...I hate doing that because it takes ages, but it needs doing. I don't have much to say but I wanted to write here as I haven't for a while, LOL

I'm way too young to have experienced either of these in the theater the first time around, so I want to go. It's only playing Monday night, but I really want to go. The lack of sleep will be so worth it.    Hmm....maybe I need to post an ad on  Craigslist .

Rotwiler) wanting to play then coward when my parents started fighting and throwing things. So I'm sitting there amid the screaming... with a headache the size of neptune and wishing blockbuster would call back so I could get a job and get out of the house for more then one day a week. I've got Mythic tomarrow... so that'll take a load off. I don't care if we're going amid giants to get a staff... I want to go. Going means I don't have to be at home. Yay. Gah. &gt;.&gt;;; Merr.  Well that's all I guess...  ~*~Sierra~*~

1	katsucon!! it better not suck this year because last year i definitely wanted to find one of the manager people and like punch them or something for not having the cosplay on a close circuit broadcast.  i had a dream last night where i was going to a maroon 5 concert and then i was at home trying to convince my dad to keep this jar of bees, except the dead bees in the jar started coming to life and needless to say i was freaking out because i don't like bees especially when they are in swarms. and every time we wanted to take jake's car somewhere we had to cut down a piece of bamboo to put in the backseat?... at least now the jet lag has completely gone so i can sleep and dream such "fun" things.

1	We spend Sat with my dad and Lori, and today we spend with Jeremy's parents. We had fun at both. It was kind of a relaxing weekend. The only thing that sucked was my sister being mean to my dad. I wish she would stop that. It hurts him and she just doesn't get it. She is 18 and should know by now to be nicer. I am doing pretty well though. Yay. I am trying to get into college right now. I really want to be a vet, and if I don't do something now I probably won't ever.

0	Well.... another post so soon... Got home from a day out with the roommates to find a message from my mom asking me to call her.  So I did. Turns out that the older of my two uncles (2 years younger than my mom) died.  No one had been able to get in touch with him for the past two days so my grandparents asked the cops to check on him.  They had to break into his house and they found him.  It looks like he died in bed from pneumonia, probably on Thursday.    Kelsey, you will be missed.  That's two bad events... I'm waiting for the last anvil to drop.... and I'm guessing it will either tomorrow or Monday, when I have yet another job interview.

1	1. Reply to this post, because I would like to say a couple words about you. 2. I will also tell you what song(s) remind me of you when I hear it. 3. I will also tell you what celebrity/public [or anime/manga] person you remind me of, either personality-wise or looks-wise. 4. I will also give ONE WORD that I associate with you when I think of you. ((5. We all could use a boost now and then, so steal this for your journal and make someone else's day as well))  Hope I can do justice to this ^.^
1	Today is a very important day. Its the day that I woke up even earlier then normal, that work will move at a snails pace, and that I have to run all over town afterwards to get things done in time.  Liz will be arriving in town. We only get one visit this time before I go home, and its only for this long weekend. But hey, its here now. 80 days later... damn thats a long time!  At any rate you won't see or hear much of anything from me until monday.
0	 Usually, when I make a long rant, I feel better about myself afterwards, because I've let out how I feel. But it's different this time. Looking deeper into what I wrote, I don't hate her - I hate MYSELF. I'm a stupid, evil, jealous hypocrite. I wear a wristband saying "Beat Bullying", when I am a bully. It isn't her who deserves to die slowly, painfully and soon, it's me. I'm lazy, I'm cowardly, I'm horrible, I'm as fucked in the head as can be. So much bad stuff happens to me, and I deserve everything I get.   - b.k. x  PS. In case you think this, I don't want sympathy or attention - hence disabled comments.
1	*sniff* No       dcontaminant    coming down this weekend because he has a paper to write.  I was so looking forward to seeing Martin!  However,       k_totem    has still decided to come down!  I'm not sure when he's getting here, but we'll be heading out to Paradise at that time.  Tomorrow we'll be going to the old Lot 20 for some hot band action!  I haven't been to Lot 20 in forever.  I wonder if Shaken still has my picture up...  Tomorrow I'll be forcing Lemmy to go to State Street.  Ooooo, this shall be a delightful weekend, pending Lemmy finding his way to my apartment.
0	well. tonight i didnt do much at all. i ended up staying home ..it was kinda nice though.  who knows what tomorrow holds. i was supposed to hang out with some friends but i guess it just wasnt meant to happen silence is all around me...its strange..my music is playing, the tv is on downstairs...but still it seems so silent.   im not sure why i feel disappointed...but you know what. i wish for your happiness and mine.  She gave me a bunch of crap about me not listening to her, I don't know I wasn't paying attention.  Jeff Daniels, Dumb and Dumber
0	watched oprah with clabo today and i basically got real bummed out...  forgotten letter... so sad  bethany puked in the target parking lot. bought undies to tie die... they are mens.  made a boondogle keychain.  tried to turn in my paper, its early me=idiot.  lynsey says god didnt see it that way for me, which makes sense...no correction, about 5 months ago that would have made sense to me.  i try, i really do...and i guess sometimes i just get too down.  i feel like sometimes i get too dark...  met my sisters friend patrick, her smile makes me happy again. bad news she leaves in april for virginia... for 5 months. i wont get to see her on my birthday. that makes me awfully sad.  saw some spring break pictures today...they are cute!  bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzz all day long
1	This week has been fun. Super chill and easy. School is boring, but it isnt hard so thats all good.  Tonight was Tijuanas which was fun, and I watched soccer. Its so funny how Brian gets involved in it. He makes these goofy faces, and makes weird noises to imitate the poor deaf referees. Blue team won, which according to Brian, they shouldnt have because that team is like the Lakers, they buy all their players. Tonight was also the Balkard/Fern Creek basketball game. I got there kinda late, but still had a really good time. Towards the end, I was getting kinda excited and nervous cuz the game was really close, but the Bruins pulled through and won by 9 or something similar.  On the way home my dad really surprised me. He started going fast, like 95, and was weaving in and around traffic. My mom would have #### a brick if she found out, but I was just surprised my dads ###### car could go that fast.  Im afraid of Laura's dad.

1	I went to Dammon's and dropped off my first application I've ever filled out ( : almost exciting.  Haha!  You know what?  I love my life.  Lol, I don't know where that came from, but I do.  I wouldn't give it up for the world.  ( :
1	1. go into your lj's archives. 2. find your 23rd post (or closest to). 3. find the fifth sentence (or closest to). 4. post the text of the sentence in your lj along with these instructions.   "I see a lotta people w/ all this drama goin' on, and some of it's really sad... cheer up people..."   chrissy came by jones after skool. probably the best thing that could of happened 2 me today.   no, not probably.. definitly  im jus so happy that it looks like everything is gonna work out okay. i was walkin out into the courtyard n looked up. there she was, right in front of me.. i was kinda suprised (it was a good suprise) but at the same time, it was expected. We jus chilled for awhile, went over to the park. The last time i'd seen her was emily's party. spring break. Jus being able to hold and see her again was like, jus wonderful, n plus she was lookin sexy as hell, haha. i love her so much, and everything jus feels like its goin right again.
1	I'd just like to wish       cameronwolfe    a very happy birthday! *slides him a cupcake with a single birthday candle on it* Make a wish wolfy and I hope you had a great day *hugs ya tightly*
0	not really much to say now.  just had the impulse to make an entry.  this should help distract me from staring at my xanga and livejournal pages, waiting for comments.  nobody comments unless i ask them, or bring it up, so whatever.  guess it's just a bad habit to expect that.  this should all be for my own satisfaction.  of course, it's 99% for my satisfaction and stress relief.  wow, that was a random tangent.  anyway, what i think i'm saying is that i'm gonna quit livejournal for a bit and recollect my thoughts.  if you want to read my xanga...  http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=DTs paz   there you go, there's the link.  anyway, i'm gonna zoom now.  got things to do.  if you see necessary, call me or im me.  i love company. &lt;3/
0	This is nothing... just wanted to write a little something:     Everytime I look into the sky,  I see your smiling face.  I then remember all the times we shared,  And look to the ground in pain.  The mere thought of you kills me inside,  So I've been trying to forget.  But everytime I come close...  Something reminds me of you.  The pain it all builds up inside,  Making me wish, wish to die.  I can't believe this,  I thought that I was through.  Guess I was wrong,  I'm not over you...       Feh... I'm not really in a happy-ass mood so don't expect too many happy and or cheery things in the next few days. Later, Ja Ne.    ~*Kirsten*~
1	 Yesterday was a lot of fun, even though I didn't do much of anything but walk down 5th Ave.&nbsp; I was with Cassie and Andy, and we just wandered around yesterday morning into places like Gucci, NBC, H&amp;M, Hershey's Store, and Ray's Pizza.&nbsp; I wish we had more time and money, cause we could have taken a tour of the NBC studios, or Radio City Music Hall.&nbsp; I didn't get many pictures, but here are some:         I think these are called "The Gates" in Central Park.&nbsp; I thought they were a little weird...and a bit ugly too.&nbsp; However, it brightened everything up and seemed to keep the wind down.         This one is really dark...dang! Anyway, it's me and Cassie in front of Carnegie Hall with our poster :) 
1	well I think I finally things figured out. I've decided on what I going to OFFICIALLY make my major, not just what I spew out to everyone, and the more I think about it the more excited I get. Granted, I still have no idea what kind of career I'm going to have, but I'll worry about that one later. Just the fact that I have a major is thrilling to me. My major will officially be Biophsychology once I get all the paper work taken care of. I think it'll be great fun.   Speaking of great fun, this weather is completely awesome! I love love love it!  It feels good to have spring and a general purpose for life. I swear the past few quarters have been extremely depressing, it the context of school, and I'm so glad to have something to look forward to.
1	Apparently I am neurotic and paranoid. It must go hand in hand with my hypochondria. You can disregard my post from yesterday. The doctor called, no I lied, I called him, actually, I lied again.....I was too afraid to call him, so I made Jeff do it. Anyhow, all is well :) Ultrasound tomorrow!
1	YAh!the bf liked his b-day present. This girl on his floor cooked us cury chicken with rice for dinner and it was all yummy yummy then we all went bowling. Bowling was pretty fun, it was the first time i bowled. I got a strike on the very first bowl but it went down hill from there.  The place we went to used to have a DDR machine but they took it out which sux cuz i really wanted to play cuz i haven't since i got back to school and it didn't help that Dave was blasting DDR music from his speakers.But i be home on Saturday so all is good.
0	so im watching love actually.  it reminds me of shawn  and when she told me how she had cried right when it started  and i hadnt seen it and thought she was nuts.  but then i saw it and it had the same effect on me.  and yes, once again its doing it to me again.  god im a retard.
1	 The archery T-shirts are in!   ^___________________^  They're here, and they're totally beautiful. &lt;3  ...Of course, maybe I shouldn't say that, 'cause I designed them. O_o  Eeeeeeh, what the heck. Everyone else says it too. XD
1	  &nbsp;Awww, The weather today is just... Great !&nbsp; i really wish i could spend the day out, but yeah.. gotta stay at the office untill 6 today :(     &nbsp;by the way,  The celebration of the Nations &nbsp;&nbsp;is today from 6-9 pm in the CMU ball room.

1	I got my first taste of what it's like to be a merchandiser tonight, it wasn't too bad i suppose, but definately a lot more physical work than selling on the floor.  Tomorrow we head for the stag and doe in Forest. I can't wait to introduce Casey to the rest of my friends. Megan is coming too so it will be an amazing night full of fun and booze.  I also can't wait for the wedding, it's going to be absolutely beautiful. I'm so happy for you both Adam and Trish. Anyway better get to bed...
1	hey my internet is working! cool. so life is good for now. grades suck but i guess thats my fault. spring break is gonna be heaven. skate jizzel on the 21st. be there or be square! lol. i think it's about time for a haircut. its getting on my nerves. just a trim. i also got a myspace now. what are you supposed to do on those things anyways???? tryin to stay hip.

1	  Finally went to look at drum kits yesterday. Wow...so many choices...I think I'll hafta consult with some drummer buddies of mine to see what brand they started out with..Pearl,Tama,Yamaha...This is such a huge investment, not to be taken lightly      Ran into Steve Grady there too in the keyboard section. We both did a double take and then he's like "I know you!". And then guess what song he started to play? "Let it Be"! ;)      It's the first day of spring...really? It don't feel like it!      I need total concentration right now. I shouldn't be writing in here, I came on strictly to do research and take 6...count 'em..6 Chemistry quizzes.       &nbsp;

0	I want my leaders to be fiscally responsible.  I want my leaders to respect and uphold the Constitution and Bill of Rights.  I want my leaders to respect all three branches of government and the system of checks and balances.  I want my leaders to respect the separation of Church and State.  I want my leaders to be ethical.  I want my leaders to have respect for life. (I mean   ALL   life not just lives that are politically expedient.)  I want my leaders to represent me, not just some lunatic fringe (i.e. the party "base") or special interest.  I want my leaders to show reason and compassion.  I want my leaders to be honest men.  I want my leaders to respect and care for the environment.    I want my country back! I pray to God that he save us from ourselves.  I want my leaders to do the right thing. Lately it doesn't seem like they are.

0	I don't understand.  Moody's father, he disowned him this morning for sleeping with Dylan (I lack words to describe how I feel about this, I truly do).  He sent him this horrible Howler, yelling about Luce and everything.  What is it with Ravenclaws and putting Luce in their Howlers?  But I don't understand why it matters who Moody is sleeping with.  I mean, if he gets married and has an heir eventually, why does it matter with whom he's having liasons and how?  I don't see why it matters.  The Mulcibers don't seem to care, save for that daughter of theirs, Cynthia.  She looks like a walking corpse half the time, anyway.  Is that appealing to English men, to have a woman who looks dead, she's so thin?  I don't understand this country.  I hope Malfoy Manor will always be a refuge for me, more Continental, more like France...away from this madness.  Poor Moody.  For all my dislike of him, I feel bad for him.  ~Bella
1	Tracy got a new Audi TT roadster convertible!!!  It is the cutest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. I get it next year when she goes abroad, because if it wasn't for me she wouldn't have it. My parents are even obsessing about it!!!  I also just saw seabuiscuit and it was so good. The book was better though so read the book first. Tobey was really hot in it (despite the red hair).
1	I figured I would update in the 10 minutes before I have to leave for class.  Life is good.  Classes are going well, Mike and I are good, Aileen's birthday was yesterday (happy birthday!), I'm pretty sure Jackie's still in Rhode Island, I have a single (!)..yeah, I'm just happy.  Mike and I are going skiing on Saturday and that has made me happy all week.  Then there's Valentine's day...I love Valentine's day so much.  I'm so glad that Aileen is enjoying school.  Dave and I are doing pretty well..we still need to find out exactly what normal is and what we're going to do about it, but I'm not worried.  I hope everything is going well for everyone else.  The whole rumor deal was silly and everything is fine.  Sorry I didn't update you, Annie...but I hope you're having fun at Duke and that you and Greg are still wonderful.  Ok, off to class.  Happy Weekend!
1	I love life.  I love it again.  I'm not especially happy with some things, but when I look at the sky and spend time with my friends I feel so ALIVE.    I'm like a yoyo.  I have an acceptance of death and then a horror.  I have a day when I feel like the world is the brightest place and then a day of dreading leaving my room.  I have times where the idea of life scares me more than death, and times when I want to help life to succeed.  I bought a ferret.  I bought a baby ferret!  I love that life.   I just want the love of a tiny little animal.
1	After starting 24 hours and 10.5 time zones away, I arrived in Minneapolis a little ahead of schedule, shortly after 4:00 p.m. Ctein picked me up at the airport and, ignoring pleas of my loyal subjects, whisked me straight home (do not stop at the MN-Stf meeting, do not collect 200 questions) where there was tail-wagging, purring and glee-shouting from Ericka, Brandy and Vegas (not necessarily in respective order). I've just awoken from a well-deserved nap and will be having another in short order. I'm back to work on Monday night.
0	Tonight i sat pulling peices off a chicken and eating them... alone.  It was comforting and depressing at the same time... but i think it's the closest thing i have to a comfort food. no one who reads this will really understand.  just gotta keep breathing.  it would seem i have a new hobby i only make them when i'm alone... they're small and salty and go down warm... but  i wouldn't recommend it.  i tuned my guitar a half step down just to learn Dashboard Confessional songs. now i can learn the song that gets me every time... and blur the days away                     .die young and save yourself.
0	Fuck.  So, yesterday morning when mum and dad come to pick me and my brother up from Devon she tells me that Grandad was admitted to hospital - he needed to take some antibiotics for some fluid on his lungs, so they wanted to keep him somewhere safe just until it clears up. Mum decided not to tell me and Mathew because it might upset us.  Anyway, we're about halfway home and the phone rings - the hospital want us to get there NOW.  Grandad died yesterday afternoon.  Fuck fuck FUCK.  I love you grandad.
0	 have you ever passed by a spot  that u havent been by in quite some time and recall a memory...a very  good memory...that wont get out of your head all day and makes you long  for  the days that once were ....sigh...........        &nbsp;I havent much to say  except that Mr. Moody ruined my life. Thats right. My life. Not just my  day, but he butchered my kickass essay so much that now I feel  inadequate, ignorant and utterly idiotic. I got my oil changed today,  it was quite an experience. I also applied for a job at Ulta; they are  fully staffed for the time being.  So thats the gist of my day.  
1	OMG!!! I AM SO EXCITED!!!!  i am actually finally 15!!!!

0	I feel like absolute shit right now.  Hopefully I won't drink myself into a stupor and stumble into work with a hangover tomorrow...

1	Okay well yeah I was supposed to go to my dr's appointment for surgery tomorrow. Um yeah, they called and there like we need to reschedule. I'm like okay. So I was happy about that but bummed because I was looking forward to going home. So I am going home anyway. I need to get some stuff for saturday. Oh my gosh I can't wait! So tomorrow I plan on sleeping in and leaving the house at 12:30 to be back in time for my sarah and SGA! I ssooo can't wait! For the rest of the week it is so going to rock!   I'm also happy because I am feeling so much beter. But I woke up this morning coughing so badly until I drank something. Wasn't cool. But thats all that is really left of the sickness which is good. :)I woke up in a good mood (despite coughing) and I"m in a a even better one now! YAY  *happy dance**
1	WHO WANTS TO GO WITH ME TO  DRAGON*CON ?  Atlanta.  Early September.  Please oh please oh puh-leeeeeez?  Jacqueline Carey will be there.  You KNOW I have to go.  Kushiel's Legacy is a work of awesomeness and I'll CRY if I don't get to go.  CRY like a LITTLE GIRL.  While on the phones at work, asking people if they eat frozen french fries.  Jackie: "Do you or anyone in your family eat frozen fries?" Random southern woman: "No, ma'am." Jackie: "GOOD!  THE SURVEY IS OVER!  AND SO IS MY LIFE!  ::bawl::"  Haha, I kid.  Now come with me to the con.

1	Last night  Flux  posted a  "Snippet"  of one off their upcomming EP.  Why am I posting this?  1- Flux  is my boyfriend's band. 2-I'm the Webmistress of  fluxband.com  but mostly... 3- This snippet made me wet myself!!!      Okay so it's not as interesting as it sounds, but last night I just happened to visit the  fluxband  page just minutes after the  snippet  was added... Strange, eh??   Well, I went to play it and as I was reaching to turn up the volume on my speakers... I knocked over my glass of water... all over my laptop.. thankfully nothing was ruined, save for the disc I was burning at the time.. since I had to move the laptop around to make sure it got dry. ah well..  So yeah.. if you haven't gotten around to it by now...  CLICK THIS BIOTCH AND LISTEN!!!   Thanks! ^_~
1	Friday started with a weather forecast calling for a gray and dismal weekend. And I was ready for it. Well... as best I could be that is.   But we talked.. and held eachother and talked some more. Confessed things and reassured feelings that we've known all along:  Love is good. Pain is bad. Not just to love someone else, but to love yourself. And to have the strength to say 'I am not perfect and I need you'. So, it starts.. good or bad... it's honest. And thats a true sign of real love.   In the end.. Love is stronger than fear and you can only move forward with hope.  Win, lose, or draw... we will never be the same. But isn't that the point?   It's always just a chance but I have a feeling this just may work.  I see a big road ahead of us with lots of adventures crossing our path. And I'm lucky to have this girl walking along side of me. So lucky. So very lucky. (shuttt up Clarice...)
0	Is it just not meant to be? Am I just not good enough for anyone? Am I just meant to be second to everything? I don't know if I can handle that. I rather be alone than be second to something like Meijer. I mean I understand being second to family, friends, other loved ones, occupations, but NOT Meijer. And I don't know if that's something I can get over. I've always been second to Meijer. From my first relationship to my last. Is it that I'm that horrible of a person to be not good enough to be comparable to a oversized grocery store?
0	I know it has been a long time since I've written, but I only have one short observation to make.  First, understand that I oppose the war like nearly half of the US population and the majority of the world population.  I am being told to "support our troops" regardless of whether I support the war or not.  However, I do not support our troops in this aggression.  "I was just following orders" is not an excuse when you are ordered to do something that is wrong.  The international community has said "no".  Most Americans that have an opinion to voice have said "no".  This war is being fought on behalf of a few spiteful people, and not on behalf of the American populace or the world populace.  So, no, I will not "support our troops" (whatever that is supposed to mean, anyway).
1	  Hey guys! I'm so happy! Last Saturday, I was at Rockwell with Betti, Elli, Bella, Ericka and Sabs. Ran into Kyna, Iya and Danie like 10 times. We watched White Chicks!&nbsp;It was funny. Betty laughed much even though she already watched the DVD version. It was really great. We were complete pa. I wanted to get my hair cut but I bought shoes instead, well actually my mom bought them for me. Lili, I think we officially made up. Oh and I love my brother, he was so cute today. We played all morning in TimeZone. I love typing. Argh, I'm dreading&nbsp;Tues. There's like a million things to submit. Oh, and I got really upset when I saw Alex's new video again: Anything. He was kissing that horrid girl. Well, see you all! Have fun on Monday. &nbsp;&nbsp;  
1	I'm in Georgia until next Tuesday, so I'll be on LJ on and off.  =)
0	Emily's gone :( and we only just got to the station with about 2/3 minutes to spare because of Toy Story 2 and the rain and wind. It was still really cool to see her though, and im hoping she had a good time because I did! We went to Fuzz and Corp and Nathan came along and we met his house mate and also Kathryn (not sure if that's spelt right, sorry) and I was bad and did tequila and Emily did a shot so I didn't feel as bad. Also saw Jill and John and other random people which was cool :)   People should go see       starbrite_icons    because she has done some really lovely icon thingys (which is why I now have some)
0	Oh man, did I miss my computer.  I have been deprived of my amusement for a whole two months.  I didn't realize that I would miss it that much.  I have survived my mother, but I probably don't want to count up the emotional hits I took.  I have remained unimpressed with individuals who waste their lives in drugs and alcohol.  Do they even realize that lives are shit and these things are really controlling their lives.  This world is sad.  A mother and her boyfriend who has been using drugs can't wake up to feed their infant.  Their child is taken from them because of their daughter's malnourishment.  A mother goes on drunken binge and the father, a drug dealer, takes their child away.  This is the world we live in.  More later need to time to adjust to my house again.
0	Hey girls, I really wish I could be there with you guys. Im so bored and I feel like shit. But my surgery is on Friday at St. Alphonsus (scary I know). But clue me in on Liz acting like a normal human being. Is she back to "pretending" that she's like the rest of us?? Need info please!!! Anywho, I hope to be back at school by next wednesday and I'm pretty sure that everyone is talking about how quiet classes are now or how much they really despise me. Oh well, you cant please everybody (some more than others, Rose you know what I mean). Well I have to go but I love you all and miss you a lot. I'll see you soon.  Mandy
0	this is who i used to be... still am... either way, still unsure.              blah1105         i remember who i used to love. what we used to do. everything that used  to be. i miss it. i miss those people i left behind when i changed.    became this mess. i miss before...

1	new buddy icon... hehe it makes me smile because i went into the trash to get the box to make this sign, only to be yelled at by airport security
1	Dang, didn't know it had been so long since I updated, my internet time has been sporatic at best considering if I get on at home my parents are constinly looking at what I'm doing.  I've managed to land a job at Krogers working produce, it pays crap but it pays and has health coverage.  I'm working on getting a good paying job with a local security firm, I just need to wait for them to finish my background check.  Shouln't be to bad since I haven't done anything to give me a record yet.  That and I applied for a position at Wright-Patt air force base, it'd be a big feather in my cap if I could get that one.  If all goes well I'll have enough to move out of my parents house and into an appartment by the begining of May.  Other then that, life is quite dull with work, eat, sleep, and hang out with my friends once a week.  Hope it stays that way for a while yet.
0	I understand that the TV chief folkees are trying to reverse the obesity trend, particularly in the young. This is good, and I see the reasoning for it and so on.  But really,  some things  must be kept sacred. Seeing him devour an apple while getting bits everywhere just won't be as good.  ...Not that I still watch it, of course, I'm talking nostalgia/cynicism here.
0	Last night I noticed that Chen hadn't gotten up to play yet, so I got into his cage to check on him. I guess you guys can all figure out what happened. Chen Chen was only a year and a month old. I don't know what happened. He seemed fine. He was always so sweet and so loving. He was the smallest of our hamsters, but we suspect he was the product of inbreeding (we purchased his mother pregnant), so we didn't worry too much about that.   Anyway, that's sort of sucked the life out of the end of spring break for me. It's particularly awful because Wes made sure we'd had a great evening. We went to J&J's pizza and then the used bookstore, then to Beth Marie's for ice cream. It was really nice, relaxing, fun.
1	Had fun playing with all my toys today.  Mummy and I went out for a walk round the village this afternoon.  I really enjoyed it but I fell asleep on the way home.  Mummy's been working hard in the kitchen making me lots of food (I think she's feeling tired now!)  Just going to have my bath then time for Bed!!
0	Well I just called my dad to tell him about applying for graduation..and I found out that my Uncle Bobby died today.  We all knew he was on his way out..he'd been sick for a long time..but still...we'll miss him.
1	not much to say, really.  nikki's moving back in tomorrow... great.  also, i am leaving tomorrow... wish forever, but i'm not that lucky.  but i am excited cause im takin a trip to new orleans to visit my friends from i lived there.  its kinda weird cause i havent been there for like 5 years... wow.  but ive kept in touch with most people from there and we are gonna have an awesome time hangin out together... just like old times except were all 5 years older, lol... anyway, i guess i'll update more when i get back.
0	You know what's annoying? When people draw attention to your failures, and then make fun of you for it. Its even worse when its a grand, spectacular failure which really bothers the person who is failing.
1	Oh yes, and Taking Back Sunday in one week. I absolutely cannot wait, it's going to be so fucking awesome.
1	I made it to the final day, 20.  I'm about 15th in chips with 1000-2000 blinds, so I'm hoping just to hang on.  I have 13.5 k in chips.    Two days!!!  Thanks for the luck last time, it definitely came through today.
1	Wow, lately I've been feeling this sort of emotion that I had rather forgotten about.  Happiness.  Simple, pure happiness.  I had rather thought it was out of reach.  "'Cause when I talk about you It's just like the movies I've seen" 
1	  so msi is tanight... its gonna be hella fun. i'll be back ta tell you all about it on tuesday. =p i'm soooo excited.  
0	i am extremely depressed today...i didnt even have a dream about him last night...although i did dream i was running through esplanade mall naked....dont even ask cause i have no idea where that came from.....i wish i never had dreams...they mean nothing to me.....i just took the longest bath of my life.....i am going to lafeyette with liz on april 8th im gonna need to get out of the house on that day...i am going watch my little brother play baseball at lakewood today....maybe i can talk to my mom....i need her help...ugh i hate this....and i am also going to bible study today...even though i dont want to
0	   I need a Tim Patch. Like a nicotine patch....to help me get over him.  i dont want to get over him.  i HATE being strong.
1	Mark's friend arrived, he's really a great guy.  We' ve talked a lot, just getting to know   each other.  But that's not what  I'm here to talk about, though it's great that he's here.   We've been looking for a house, and we found one we liked, and we got it! I'm so excited!  It...it's real. I know we have been for a long time, but it's...permanent. And amazing. And wonderful....  God, to think after all this time...I've found what I didn't know I was looking for.  Two wonderful husbands, good friends, my family. I'm lucky beyond words.  So far from my past...  No sadness, this is a   good day. I love and am loved.  The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.
1	Guess who got accepted and is moving to Philadelphia, PA next year?
0	so...yeah...worst night of my life? worst night of my life.

0	 Andre Norton died.  I haven't read many of  her books , but the ones I've read were good.
0	Well, we didn't go to temple last night to go sledding.  It got too late and Steve and David had to dig a car out last night so that didn't happen.  We got at least a foot of snow out here.  I also had the worst nightmare last night, it was ridiculous.  I thought I'd have more to say on here but guess I don't feel that talkative.  I'll try again later.
1	Am currently in Ely waiting for news on my placement. The school that got half burnt down isn't open till the 25th April so Uni is looking for a new school for me. So at the moment I am enjoying spending time with *ahem* people in Ely ;o)
0	Well, I didn’t get that job. Nice to know I’m still worthless…and pointless…and no one wants me.   *big, fake smile* I was worried for a while there, thought something might have changed.
0	Why am I sitting here alone on a saturday nite? It's not the first time, most likely won't be the last. If I were in Northern Ky, I would NOT be at my house (at least not alone). Honestly, I hate to whine, but I have but 2 true friends here at this school. And since they have both gone home this weekend...you know. You will remember of course, that I was SUPPOSED to be home this weekend, and I am not. This adds to the anguish. Because I know what I would be doing there right now, and who I would be with...and it SUCKS. What's the point of my trying to get to know people? Of my being as sweet and caring of a person that I can possibly be? In the end, someone or something always gets chosen over me, like I don't even count. I'm hungry, and I can't have food. I'm lonely, and I can't be around people. That's all I really wanted to do tonite. But I'm in Lexington, so that's too much to ask. I DO try to make connections with people. It hasn't happened. I hate this place.
0	I was saddened when I found  this . But, I can only consider myself lucky to once having had the opportunity to spend 3 years at the most beautiful campus I have ever seen.
1	Today I get to go to the mall with Meghan and KT! =D and best of all... my mom is actually letting us go without her! Over protective mothers....Yeah, but anyways, I'm so excited. We get to go as soon as KT wakes up. -.- that could take a  while. But my mom will probably only give us enough money for a pair of socks. But us three have our own money. And we all have gift cards, too, to Maggy Moo's, Hot Topic and Claires. I don't really like Claires, but whatever.  *Makes Ruby jump on KT's bed so she wakes up* *KT screams and hits Ruby*
1	... well, at least by the standards of January in Washington, DC. I made my way down to the C&O canal today, and as usual snapped a few images while traveling the tow path and the trails that occasionally branch off from it.  Hope everyone who was around here enjoyed the wonderful weather, and didn't spend all day inside. As usual a few image follow. There were some rather interesting cloud formations, and there was some interesting lighting prior to sunset.        rather interesting looking cloud formation, unfortunately it seems that the camera couldn't deal with all the light levels      taken facing east as the sun was getting low in the sky  
0	 &nbsp;     The past two Tuesdays Im happy but now… I cant describe it…    Should I be happy?? This is the question that I keep on asking…. Its just been what…. 4 months…. With that 4 months, my life has been change somehow… with all the talking… chatting… fooling around… I will miss all those things…. I know its not permanent… well everything is not permanent in this world… but I know you’ll be back.. and I’ll just hold on that thought… on that promise…     &nbsp;    I’m really gonna miss you…   
0	is dead and it's gone. inside there's sadness, i live alone. sorry...lol, just having a little musical theatre moment. good christmas, back to school. got 94 on my history essay and test *dances around room gleefully* although i only got 78 on my english essay. *grumble grumble* ok, five minutes til alias starts. we had to put my cat down last night. he had heart disease, threw a blood clot, was paralyzed and then his body started to shut down, and he began to drown in his own fluids. thats pretty much it. i g2g

0	Looks like I skipped Wednesday...oh well, on to Thursday.  Tuna salad on ww pita  Annies Mac and Cheese  1 pierogie  slice of cheese and spoonful of peanut butter  Now, would you believe I actually *gained* about half a pound after that wonderful eating day?!? Actually, I am not surprised at all.  This weight loss thing is a delicate balance and I have not been doing what I am supposed to lately.  Not enough fruit, not enough veggies, too much meal skipping.  Honestly, I am just trying to get through every day without barfing and eating whatever seems like it might stay down.  So until I am feeling better (hopefully soon...maybe even today.  I feel pretty good this morning) proper nutrition is having to take a back seat.
1	SO  I finally got my haircut today!   Wendy had to shave it down with razors forever to get it where it wasn't so thick, but I love it... It's sooo light and soft...  and it's finally long enough now so that when it grows out it won't be an instant mullet! Oh god yes.        I find that if I smile way bigger than any normal human being my pictures turn out better. :D        Now I just need to re-dye it something interesting.
0	today was the worst day of my life. michael died this morning @ 3am. my best friend in the world. im seriously at a loss for words i really dont know what to say. im absolutely devestated.   there is really nothing to say i guess.     R.I.P. Michael 7/21/04.....I love you

0	Just finished working out.   If only I could get my lazy ass to do it everyday I would probably be in much better spirits.    Been down in the dumps this past week,  and I have about zero motivation to do anything.  I have to clean the house tonight in preperation for march sucks party.   I am hoping that it will raise my spirits.  IF anything I will at least be full of spirits.   All in all I guess it could be worse.   I could be paralized from the neck down, or have cancer or something.
0	   Hey ppl im back from ohio b/c i went with my family and bri came along with us....then like the whole trip my mom was yellin @ me b/c my brother would do something and i'd say something and i'd be the one who got into trouble.

If anyone is REALLY desperate, you can text-message me from  gorlim's  profile page, which is really pretty nifty. ;-)   I am going to see horses tonight!!! Go me. Hopefully I will not start a revolution. Al rides, so I'm gonna watch. We're shopping at Pentagon City then... uhh... I have no idea. Anyway, will be out.

1	Well last night was a pretty good Senior Night, we beat Oak Ridge 71-52.  This week has been pretty busy.  We lost a couple of heartbreakers to Jones, DP, before Oak Ridge.  We finished our season 16-9, JV finished 11-6 and Freshman( not that it matters) were 7-5.    Today I just went to church, watched UNC- UConn, then some of the Spurs- Heat and then a bit of Cavs- Lakers, before I went to shoot with John.  When I came home, I finished Bunker's research paper, which he paid me a decent sum of money to do, and the funny thing is I didn't have to do much.  I feel sorry for Bunker, I just wanna see him get out of HS.  A 5th yr senior is a laugher.  Anyway, there hasn't much other than basketball that has gone on, progress reports came out and I got 3 A's, and 3 B's, which is good.  I just hope I can keep em that way.

0	[Private]  I owled Draco. It's been a few days. Maybe I should just owl him again. Or perhaps he just wants to be left alone. If that's what he wants. I will surely give it to him. I have been selfish and hurtful.   I sit here touching the necklace, and it's so dull. He's unhappy and I know I caused that. But I certainly didn't mean to. God, why did I fuck this up? He means so much to me. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.   [/Private]  Jean confessed to me last night that he likes Will. Apparently he's bisexual. I'm happy for him, Will's a great guy.   I just wish I could be as happy right now.  Where are you? What are you doing? Did you get my letter? Are you just not replying?  Are you with someone else? Were you with a girl? Does she love you? Does she want your children? Is she better then me? All you ever wanted? Is she what I could never be?   I wish I knew.  Harry
1	So I am working on a self portrait right now, with oil paints as my medium. At first I was thinking about painting it in red tones, but as I was painting the background tonight, I decided to paint a New England atmosphere in the background. It would have the Narragansett Bay, with many sailboats dotting its waters, with the Newport Bridge off in the distance. I have also decided to include one of the many spectacular New England summer sunsets. Oh this painting is going to be FABULOUS, you's guys!!
0	I opened my eyes in bed, and the morning was soggy and all stormy... It seems that my plan of going back to Beirut on an early basis had been ruined...  I guess it's full weekend dorms for me...  I guess I will have to work on the sample comic I  was requested to do ...  Later, the boys did make a big pizza order, and they somehow "accidentally" managed to leave me out of the ordering, but fortunately Eyas did offer me half a slice of his half-pie pizza... Sounds like a rip-off, it doesn't matter to me - I just love to taste pizza, and I already had another form of lunch...  Later, so internet scrapping did me loads of good!!  I finally finished the sample comic too - I'll probably hang it up sometime here for you people to see...  I have to go now...  Oh yeah, before I forget!!   Anyone who is an anti-MSN and an AIM user should be informed that today I finally opened a new AIM account!! If you wish to add me to your AIM Buddy List, my new screenname is:  hopenforever

1	Flaming Polyamorist Congratulations! You scored 91% Polyamorous!    You are probably too poly for your own good! It sounds like you try to deal fairly and honestly in all your relationships and communication is a high priority with you! If you didn't cheat on this test, then you probably wouldn't cheat in real life! You, however, are a dyed in the rainbow colors of the parrot poly!

0	My hair looks horrible! My cousin convinced me to straighten my hair so I finally decided to give it a try. I went to the salon yesterday and it took 5 hours, from 4pm to 9pm!!!I sat there for 5 hours to get my hair straightened! My cousin sat at the salon and waited with me...I felt bad. I was so hungry too. And how did it turn out??? Bad!!! I don't like it! My hair looks super flat. I can't stand it! I can't bare to look at the mirror! Why did I do this to myself? I thought I needed a change, but this is not how I wanted! I'm not supposed to wash my hair for three days, but I'm gonna wash it tomorrow! I hope at least some volume will come back. I hope, I hope, I hope.

1	After double-checking with Mom and Dad that it was okay, I headed out to the Bronze to meet Buffy and Xander. I'd seen them both one-on-one style, but it'd be nice to spend some time as a group again. I don't know why we haven't lately, but it feels like a long time.  After a few minutes of hanging by myself at a table, I saw Buffy walk in, so I waved so she'd see.  "Hey, Buff," I smiled.
1	Hey guys!! Sorry i haven't posted in a while but my internet access is limited!!  The school has blocked livejournal yet again sooooo.....

Congratulations to everyone who made dance team and majorettes!!  Oh my first track meet is Saturday so wish me luck!! I'm running varsity!!!

0	Why am I such an emotional cripple? I seem to be the king of gaining friends, but entirely incapable of forming anything more meaningful. Those who I do like don't recipricate in any way, and those who i don't like are all too persistant. I don't think i am *that* ugly and I am certainly not a bad person, but here I am, after yet another Friday night - on my own.  I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin.
1	I got one of the nicest surprises tonight!  Before the Seminole YMCA Running Club took off for our 3 mile jog tonight, I was presented with a shoebox. Not knowing what exactly to expect, I asked if what was inside was going to eat me..they assured me it wasn't. Opened it up to find a box filled with running necessities....some power bars, power gels, band-aids, blister block, and a square of chocolate...for afterwards, of course!! They also stuck in a pair of cards wishing me well for Sunday's marathon in Athens.  I couldn't believe it...it was just so *nice* and unexpected. I thanked them all, and even took it easy on 'em...hey, it was the least I could do. :)
0	Details are not in the public domain at the moment, but things have taken a definate turn for the worse in Burma with a new series of arrests and clearances of internally displaced people in Karenni State.  Keep checking the various campaign websites for news and updates to campaigns and if you are inclined to do so, send your prayers to the people of Burma.  I will post info when it's been released to the press.
1	    It's been a long as time. lol So everything has been really awesome for the both of us. School is kinda dragging, but eh what else is new?! lol Nohting new has happened, i don't think. For me, soccer is awesome. I don't think roxann is enjoying golf as much lol cuz of the weather. just a reminder for everyone: Roxann's B-day is on Dec. 5!!!! Don't forget. Take care, Luvas, Christine       
1	So a few days ago i had the total Bridget Jones moment.  Me and Lauren were walking to Koresh to take a dance class and we were up near 30th street station.  This septa bus comes up real fast and blows its horn, so we look up and as soon as we do the bus trenches us with dirty, disgusting water.  It was so gross.  It just splashed up in our faces.  I actually started to hysterically laugh cause it was either that or cry.  Lauren was pissed but shes like now i can laugh about it.  I watched this movie called Blue sunday.  It was really good.  Its part of a trilogy of french movies.  Blue, White, Red.  Now i need to watch the other 2.  Not tonight though.  I feel like crap and i need a shower.  Im ready for this break off of work.  Tomorrow i go to PARIS!  Now i need to pack.

1	My internet is working again. Because I...changed the cable? on a hunch. *shrugs* Whatever works.  So I'm currently sitting here watching Family Guy while waiting "15-25 minutes" for my hair dye to, I dunno, set? It's called "Deepest Indigo" so it's going to be black with blue-ish highlight colour. :D It's partly because I wanted to dye my hair again, and partly because I wanted to dye it to be all *SPIRIT!* for Wecome Week as my faculty's colours are navy blue and silver. Weeeeeee!  I &lt;3 Stewie. :D
1	    Well! This is the terrace stray (ref-   killing - nature's way   ). I am happy to report that the kitten and the cat were doing fine when I checked an hour ago :))

0	it sucks when you've been in denial for so long and you finally have to wake up and face the facts. and here are the facts. my grandpa has alzheimers and parkinsons. and hes not getting better. ever. hes only getting worse. my grandpa who has always been smart and healthy is dying slowly. he went on a walk today and fell down. and he didnt even try to catch himself. he had to go to the hospital and get stitches. im so scared and i dont even know how to express my emotions to anyone but myself. its like suddenly im afraid of being weak and i cant let anyone know how much i care. so i hold it all in and then cry and cry and cry when im alone. and then the next day im back in denial until something else happens. i wish caitlin was here. i wish i could actually talk to any of my other friends about it. but mostly i just wish i had my old grandpa back.

0	. . . to find a good comedian. I was so happy when I came upon  Mitch Hedberg . Eerily all the times I tried to see him, something happened to prevent it. The first time, he cancelled the show last minute. The second time it snowed too bad for us to get there. And this last time, 2 days before he was supposed to be at the Baltimore Improv, Mitch died of a heart attack.  If you want to laugh a  LOT , go out and buy his CD. There are some fun quotes  here .

1	Despite things at work being a bit annoying, I had a great time this weekend. I went to a new year's eve party, and it was a lot of fun. Actually, the whole weekend was a lot of fun, despite being hung over for part of it. And I'm still feeling good from it.  I have a bunch of errands to do this morning--go to the clinic, do some shopping, drop off the recycling stuff, try to get in a reasonable workout (it's pouring rain right now), call about a billing dispute, edit my schedule, and pay the rent. After a wild weekend, now the work begins, but it's all good.
1	I get to see this guy today!!!!!    and Anne B tomorrow!     The Manager of our hall emailed this to us today:  This is to alert you that all of the doors to Holmes Hall will be locked at 9:00pm on Saturday & Sunday nights.  Should we win the basketball games, the doors will be locked early on Monday and Tuesday.  This action is being taken to ensure the safety of the residents and their property.    Please celebrate in a responsible way!  Be Safe. GO STATE     Ha   I'm ready for the riots!
1	i have had such a good day today! i wish i could just move in with the shepley family. not that my family is not good, or anything, but when i'm with them i'm so happy. i went to a movie with colin earlier in the day and then stayed at their house for dinner. they had family friends in town. i feel so loved there, like i'm a part of their family. after dinner they opened a few presents, and there was even one under the tree for me! i wish i was getting along better with colin right now, not that things are bad. i feel a little like i have to stay careful with what i say or completely disregard everything he says so i'm not slightly offended. i wish that would go away. but, i can deal with that just to be with his family like i was tonight. they even had me play christmas songs on piano and they all sang along, colin on trumpet of course. what a day! on top of that, alex came home today!
0	   I got good and bad news this morning.... The good news is that I finally got ahold of one of my very good friends from MOS school. Hes here in Iraq aswell and it was cool to catch up with old times.... I also&nbsp;recieved another&nbsp;medal. &nbsp;The bad news, I just found out that my best friends cousin was murdered by her&nbsp;boyfriend. When he found out she was pregnant, he killed her n buried her in his backyard. She was 15 years old.... Lately Ive lost so many friends. Here in Iraq, Cali and Texas.... I never knew you could lose so many loved ones in the period of months.... All I can say is that I hope nothing else happens to any of you....

0	i don't mind reading. actually, i really enjoy it. i just do no want to read the scarlet letter. i tried to read a bit today. it's such terrible drudgery! it's not that i don't understand, it's just that i am so tired. i'm tired of everything.  i feel like a totally different person. it seems like i have totally changed my perspective on anything that really counts in a matter of one month. i hate this. i feel so uncomfortable in my own skin lately. i can't exactly find a way to explain it...i just feel different.   i've gained weight too.   i am not happy. and i have no idea how to get there. i'm still trying to figure out how i got here.
1	Oh gods... a recent variation on the classic Zero Wing parody that actually made me laugh to tears when I saw it. o_o Just goes to show anything is possible.   http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/2 22458   In other news, life continues normally. Posts are posted up *hint hint*. That sort of thing.
1	I'm about to pack up and head over to the courthouse to give my argument.  (It's only two blocks away, but I am anal that way.)  I'm a complete ball of nerves at the moment, but I think I'm ready to go: I know what points I want to make, I have a good sense of how to make them, and I'm prepared for any of the questions anyone's suggested they might throw my way.  So if I don't wind up hopelessly tongue-tied, I should blow this thing away.     Or at least, that is the plan.     The other part of the plan is that after I've finished blowing this thing away, I'm going out to dinner with Alexei and Robert at  Scala's .  I haven't been there in years, and I've been drooling over their online menu all week, so as soon as these butterflies clear out of my stomach, I expect to be all kinds of excited about that.     So, here goes nothing...
1	My mom, in an act of charity, recently decided she would allow me to help out the Cubbies by cheering them on. And now look what happened -- they tied her Astros for first place. The power of the puppy strikes again.  Go Cubs! I wonder if there are any Cubs caps for dogs out there ...

1	Today was so fun!!! Dan and I were talking about snow and how that and toys stores make me feel like a little kid. Little kids eat snow and I made a joke about making ice cream out of snow and when I found a how to by typing in "snow ice cream" in google I told Dan to come over...and Dan came. Delicious vanilla snow ice cream. A snow man that looked more like a nipple. Two and a half hours because it wasn't packing snow. We used bike helmets, kitchen bowls, an empty pretzel jar, carrots and a shovel. To make the snowman not the ice cream. Pictures to come later!   The apocolypse is coming, stock up on your potatos, milk and pudding!
0	The Pope has died.  May he rest in peace and fly with the angels.  He was a good servant of God and he has rightfully earned his spot in heaven.  Enjoy the view.  While I may not be Catholic, I still respected him for he was a fellow countryman and a great leader.  See, good things can come from Poland!

1	Back to life after being in bed from Friday Night until this morning... I feel better, but I know I have to take it a little bit easy.  Vist y100rocks.com, and sign the petition and email the heads of radio one... that whole situation sucks.  Busy few weeks coming up! Oscar Party 2005 tonight!
1	Well I'm off of work and off to get dressed because tonight I'm going to the Hollywood Bowl!! Yeah.  Never been to an actual performance there before, just to one or two practices.  I'm excited because they're going to play the planets.  I love the planets.  Well, here I go.  buh-bye
1	My life hasnt been too exciting lately. Always doing the same things, I need to get away again from here. Could it be that this once exciting city is starting to bore me? Hmm...makes you think doesnt it...  Well aside from my personal boredom, I'm happy that atleast one of my friends is happy.  I'm trully thrilled about it, because the boy has such a huge heart that it just makes me extatic to hear that he is smiling again. Of course, I'm talking about my little angel boy, Gaston (      devislavedoll   ). I love to see him happy. He has the greatest smile. Once you see him, you can't help but fall in love with it. Whoever this  Monkey in the Moon  guy is, I just hope that he makes him happy. He deserves nothing but the best.  Well it's about time for me go get back to work from my 15min. Break, UFA!, I just hate being at work when I know I could be having fun at some outlet store or mall... such a nice day too!
0	Today I was told bye my father that I couldnt have my chinchila (I think that is how you spell it) anyways I told him that he is A peice of shit and that I will never speak to him ever again and thats all I have to say about that.  Number 2 I have had repeted dreams of suicide and I think that is realy fucked up I dont think about it while Im awake or anything so why does it run through my head while Im sleeping I am depressed but not enough to kill myself.  I feel realy fucked up in the head right now.  I hope to get better.  Ta Ta For Now  Peace, LOVE, and UNITY.  LOVE dan
0	OK, so day two is now over.&nbsp; The jury is still way out.&nbsp; I came home yesterday and totally deteriorated.&nbsp; I hated it and knew that it really didn't matter because I had to keep it whether it gets better or not.&nbsp; I went to bed early so I could avoid Yo and Roni asking me about it.&nbsp; I came home completely overwhelmed, totally depressed and could totally feel the aftermath inside of having to be so "together" for 8.5 hours.&nbsp; Starting a job has never been this difficult for me before.&nbsp; Never mind that the job itself is either completely brain numbing or completely over my head at any given moment.&nbsp; I am hoping this is just me getting used to working again after over a year.&nbsp; I know that is part of it.&nbsp; I just don't know yet how much.&nbsp; Not that it matters, because either way I will put on my happy face and do it even if it stays horrible.&nbsp; What choice do I have?&nbsp; Right now none.&nbsp;
1	Huzzah!  Depsite forgetting to mention to       corvidae9    that I would be local, we are still going to be meeting up all t00by like tomorrow morning!  *dances*  I love meeting my t00bs.  *Is so going to be wearing her HP shirt*    Wheeeeeeee.  And yes, the campus is nice, buildings are ugly but landscaping, beach and weather make up for it.  Am so going to need to decorate my room when I get down here, and bring a floor lamp so the flourescents aren't on all the time.  (And I just know that since I'm assuming I'm going to UCSD that Miami is going to ok the Aid I asked for.  Then I will be oh so confused.)
1	Last night we ordered pizza and watched 4 or 5 episodes of Sex and the City. It was fun! I never get tired of Sex and the City. Tonight I think we are going out to dinner with Lisa's friend Stacey. Maybe after we will come back and watch a movie. Tomorrow I think we are seeing Lindsay again and watching some more Sex and the City!   Hmmm. I thought I had more to write about!
1	Beginning to think I need a new LJ for World of Warcraft.  Another stunning evening's game.  A party of 5 (which afaik is the biggest party size) tackled the Wailing Caverns.  There were some deaths, but on the whole it went well.  In the end we all died at the same time, so resurrected in the graveyard then we all went back to the inn for a chat and then to bed.  And in real life many of us were going to bed as well :)  There's a slight problem with intense situations like that in that there's not much time for real life things happening at the same time.    Having been in quite a few parties I have some thoughts about how parties work best, but I'll save that for the forum.

0	Well not really, but I'm kinda turned off by the board as a whole now. I'm really dissapointed that this is how they do things. I thought so much better of them.  I'll probably be posting again first thing tomorrow...there's not really any other board that can compare. I still love EoFF, I'm just...uncomfortable with that, not to mention the best Cid's Knights are no longer Cid's Knights. =/  *sigh* such a sad day this was on my forum of choice.

1	The two main reasons today was such a good day:  1 ) When I got to work, I found that one of my coworkers had baked me a birthday cake. =]    2) A really cute guy shamelessly hit on me.  Woohoo!   Anyway, that is all!
0	I'm so mad that i can't go see them. i'm rediculous.  i hate people. not all of them, just most. most of them really suck ass.  today was okay i figured out why i hate some of my classes, but i'm not saying why, its completely bitchy. but true none the less.  i got to see anna laura last night.  finally. i love her so much. her hair is awwwweeesome. i admire her for it.  i don't know whats going on tomorrow. i don't know whose coming over or what time. if you had planned to come over at some point, please let me know.  my mom needs to know these things.   i need to do some homework... maybe get some more sleep. forget about the day and how much people suck.  without ... weed...
1	so i'm coming back to florida for my fall break real soon i'll be there from the 16th to the 23rd i can't wait i hope i get to see  everyone that i love (this means you, lindsay lou!)  this afternoon i'm driving down  to san fransisco with friends  for a free concert in golden gate park eeee! i'm so excited to be in sunny california for the weekend with a bunch of happy hippies i'm not so excited about having to write a 10 page paper for my history class on my laptop in the car but oh well seeing john prine and peter rowan and a bunch of other bluegrass and reggae for free will be well worth the trouble yeehaw i'm off much love
1	So today i was really sleepy. last night i went to bed at like 10 and i woke up and i felt like i got no sleep at all. I hate that!  This morning bekah and i walked to attendence to get a pre-excused form and after we went to her cheerleading coach to get her SPIRIT STICK!!! and while we were walking to get it i saw a girl with a rolled up poster and asked bekah if that was a spirit stick! ok remember this is 7:15 in the morning and my contacts aren't quite in focus yet lol  we also had an orientation for next years classes and i sat with renee (she's so awesome lol). they're making this a lot harder that it really is with all this communtiy crap. w/e i almost have all my classes chosen anyways.   it really annoys me how they say its gonna rain and it really doesn't.   I missed like half of summerland last night.   I really want to go swimming.
1	I forgot to mention in my last post that my diploma finally came in the mail! That kind of almost sort of justifies buying The Incredibles and Aladdin. Yes it does. :)
1	Today when we got home from the homeschooling park thing, I asked Jack if he wanted to go to the bathroom.  He sat on the toilet and said gleefully.  "I got that feeling in my tummy!"   And then a few seconds later, he peed!  That's the first time he mentioned a feeling.  I think that's a good step.
1	I don't think I ever really knew what love was before.  I thought I did.  I sure as hell meant it when I said it to people in the past, but I didn't really love them.  This is love.  I won't really flood my journal with my emotions on the subject because I know really, the only person who cares to hear it is Kevin, and I say it to him all the time.  Just be happy for me.  I really needed this.  I was turning into such a bitter cynic.  As for my parents, things are at a lull.  I don't see them much at all, especially since I spend the night out a lot now.  Ironically enough, our relationship is doing better than it usually does.  I think thats a cue for me to get serious and move out.  I should be wrapping this up even though I'd love to just keep wrambling.  My dad will be up in 10 minutes, and he really doesn't like to wake up for work and see me just going to bed.  Plus, I have things to do, and can't sleep later than 10.  Goodnight and farewell.
1	1) My parents have been in town for a week. It's nice being able to get have a beer at the local bar with them, and (apart from a relative paucity of kink references) have the same sort of conversation as I might have with       epanther   ,       the_mad_baker   ,       cinnamonteal   , or any of my other friends. I know many people who don't have that sort of relationship with their parents, which makes me doubly grateful that I do.  2) The December Italy trip is on, and       cinnamonteal    even got the same flights I did. Sweet. Mmmmm, 2 weeks in Rome and Naples. Must remember to call my fave hotel about reservations, though, we might be late enough for Christmas traffic.   3) Cooking. I still enjoy it, and I just added a 7 qt enameled cast iron dutch oven to the collection of gear. w00+!

1	I'm fighting with myself about going out to buy the new Sims 2 expansion pack.  I already spend way too much time playing.  I have worked out for the past 2 days in preparation.  I figure as long as I work out every day, I am worthy.  Hubby has chimed in that he's not afraid to take it away if I don't work out every day for the next 2 weeks.  Heh.  So... now I wonder, should I make the run and get it?  Or just give it some time and then go buy it....
1	Congrats to Big Poppa! He just got word that he is accepted into the  Physics PhD  program at  Emory .  Options are always nice.  You tha man Bubba.  Fuck the Vols, Go Hotlanta!!!!!!!
1	Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep... wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're just as pretty without make up.  One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have you... The one who turns to his friends and says "thats her"
1	If there is one person you can't stop thinking about, post this same exact sentence in your journal.
1	I have a little... problem.  I am addicted to the red dot.  I can't stop thinking about it!  When Mommy picks up the little pointy thing that the red dot comes out of, I can't control myself.  It's really sort of embarrassing.  She makes me do the silliest things.  Like last night, she shined it on the futon and I ran up onto the back of it.  She moved the dot back and forth, and I was entranced.  I scrambled back and forth in a mad effort to catch and subdue the red dot.  Somehow I never catch it, but someday.  Someday.
1	suprise day off!  that plumbing driving gig? not happening. way too fucking hard. way too ridiculous. i went for one day and could not take it. it was absolute hell. i'm still sore from it. after only one day! jesus! so yeah, it's savon again. the biggest down fall about all this? most likely not moving out now! :(!!!!! that sucks sooooo bad. i still have a minor chance but i'm not gonnna hold my breath.   my legs hurts so bad, i can't stand still for any more than 10 seconds without my legs cramping ultra bad. i hope it goes away.   i'm at shannel's right now. she's sleeping, i wanna go cuddle with her. it's kinda early because i left work as soon as i got there. i love my supervisor karen, she rocks.    i don't know what we're doing today but i'm sure it'll be a nice day regardless. love.

1	In the famous words of my brilliant sister, I obviously win at life.   Reason why Bekah wins at life:  1. I got the official confirmation that I was accepted into the Ireland Global Connections trip that is over Christmas Break of 2005-2006 2. I got the dorm room that I wanted with a new and improved roomie that is directly below the other third person of our little unit 3. My current roomie is living in a crappy dorm halfway across campus 4. My adviser thinks that I have really thought out my plan and gave me really encouraging remarks about my school schedule 5. My visual art professor (same as my advisor actually) said that my eraser self-portrait project was beautiful and that she really liked what I was doing with it 6. My paper is almost 4 pages and it only has to be 5 7. The paper is on The Silmarillion, which means I am writing about Tolkien  See, I obviously win at life :)
0	i had an ok day. but mostly i was either sad or upset. just too much drama going on and i wish i could fly alway and be at peace. life is hard.
0	I fear I'm on the verge of losing that optimism.  I think I need another good cry.  But whose shoulder is there to cry on now?  I wish I could accept that life isn't fair, but I can't.  Bitter jealousy reigns, and I wonder why some people have all the luck.  Or the skill, or the personality, or whatever else it is that gets them there.  And I wonder what it is that I'm missing.  What it is that makes it so that I haven't gotten what I've wanted.  I'm tempted to dwell a little bit tonight; would a little bit of that be okay?  Is that the type of thing that would be healthy?  Somehow I think that might be better than suppressing it all.  But where's the line?; where would moping become excessive?    I know that for now, at least, I need to suck it up and get stuff done.  Sigh.
1	WOO HOO! I finally finished my animation that has taken me over two weeks to do! It was worth it though!  If you want to see it, go here:   http://chanelcole.cc/forum/index.php?sh owtopic=2466   Also going to see The Aviator soon, should be fun!

1	Today, I slept! It was really really nice. It was warm, though the fan was on (my owner likes leaving the fan on because it doesn't work right or something), and I hid under the bed a bunch.  Sometime in there, before it got all dark, I saw a squirrel outside, on the big tree with wires! I jumped onto the bed and onto the window sill and I chased the squirrel on the wires. It was fun! The squirrel was sooooo scared of me because I was big and ferocious! It ran away. Someday, I'll be outside and chase them and catch them and eat them. That'll be even more fun.  My owner needs to come in and shovel my box and change my water and bring me more food! I'm really thirsty and I need to go potty  so  bad, but he has to do homework. Why does he have to leave each day and not play with me? What a meany!  I need to go - I think I hear him coming!  May your mice be sweet, Annie

1	I received a card from my 14yo cousin today.  I gave her a new Xbox along with a few games, including Halo2, and extra controllers.  I was planning to wait until Christmas, but someone tipped her off to her gift and she was so anxious I thought it cruel to make her wait.  "Dear Autie Karen Thank you so much for giving me the Xbox and everything else that came with it.  I really appreciate it and I have been working hard on Halo 2 so I can beat Tony.  Well, maybe not beat him.  Love you always, Jennelle"  Another thing that made me smile today :)
0	Started my demo today. We set up the home studio and it sounds good!!! guitar, drums..etc. Pity I haven't even got to play on it yet!! Paul and Marcus have been very creative and wonderful and they wrote a song. I wrote some piano for it ..but alas. I am seemingly not allowed to play too!! on my own demo!!! (actually..it's kinda turned into marcus and Paul's demo now...bloody boys!) They are now playing Ps2 and I am fucking bored...I wanted to write some vocals before my throat infection gets worse. Oh well. looks like we will have to wait another 3 weeks now before my voice is restored.  bah. My nose hurts.
0	as all holidays you should spend easter with your family, or failing that your loved ones. Ive spent all day with my nose burried in home work while a mst3k tape plays in the back ground. LOVE YOU MOM LOVE YOU DAD THANKS SOOOOOOOMUCH FOR NOT CALLING. " but jerry couldnt you call them?:" I dont remember the number and its a cell so i cant look it up, but fuck em. fuck the easter rabbit, and the eggs.

0	Wow, the Olympics must be winding down. There isn't a new entry since I posted this past morning. Is everyone exhausted from the gymnastics fiasco? This should get the ball rolling. Has anyone heard if any of those disputes have been resolved?  And now I understand there is Peegate. The Hungarians are being ejected left and right because they can't pee on demand. My friend,       morzsa    is beside himself. He is so upset with the Olympics now. I don't blame him. There has to be a better way to deal with this than taking away a gold medal just because someone couldn't pee when you wanted them to.  What do you think?
1	so i've been doing alot of thinking lately, and i've been seeing a theropist. Things are getting good, finally, my friends are my friends, and the ones who weren't arent in my life anymore. You know who you are. I apprieciate those who are there for me. I am happy to be at youth group most of the time. I don't want to have false hope, so i'm taking it one step at a time. I think thats why its going so well. I'm not expecting anything so i can't get dissapointed. I havent felt this way in a long time. I love me again. So I can finally love others how they deserve to be loved. except not jordan. jordan needs no love.
1	Just stopping quickly in to say hi to everyone and to let you all know I have gotten an aim sn *cheers* well um you can find me aiming away on ACShiriAp. So yeah feel free to type away!

1	to Dan and all his friends (rob, jay, jon, john, dan, walker, to name just a few that I actually sorta know).  Graduating high school...nice.  Enjoy the graduation, have fun at the party, and then you've gotta make it through another 2 weeks of constant private and family parties.  It'll be hard, but I have faith.  Can't believe it's been three years for the rest of us already...in a year, we'll be doing this from college...  Congraduations, all.

0	Okay, just forget about my last post about the marshmallows.&nbsp; They of course decide to be really mean and didn't turn out right.&nbsp; Turns out the gel doesn't set equally throughout the pan.&nbsp; So the side of the pan I check happens to have become a gel while the other half was still mushy.&nbsp; So I take it out of the pan and it's one big blob.&nbsp; Had to throw that out.&nbsp; BUT I will try it again and start earlier so it'll have more time to set.&nbsp; I just really wanted marshmallows ;_;  Well, with that I go to sleep.&nbsp; Hopefully in my dream I'll be able to make good marshmallows .... and maybe find my Devon (that would be nice).
1	i've noticed a lot of things these past few days about a lot of people, its a bummer but im glad i realized it right now.  i've been having a great time lately hanging out and not really doing much. its my last week of break and i have to say this was the best break i have ever had. i didnt get to see a few people that i wanted to hang out with and thats a bummer but i know soon enough we will make up for lost time. &lt;3 im growing my hair out and i cant WAIT until its at the length i want it to be. its going to be sex for sure. pretty stoked.   IM SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS HOT WEATHER. BEACH TIME!!!!!
1	I've been to Frankfurt a.M. yesterday and me and my dad saw a concert of Eric Clapton. Now really, that man knows how to play a guitar!  At first I was rather diappointed, because the first hour was rather calm.... I mean he played lots of Blues and quiet songs.... they were good, but you can't get ten thousand people excited with a Blues... Then at the beginning of the second hour he played "Layla" and the crowd exloded. From that on it was really good!!!! I loved it!  Only the guy who stood before me got on my nerves! Stupid guy. He came later, and then stood right in front of me. Before he had come, I was able to see the stage, and everything. He was such an ass! And his wife was dead I think. How can you not sing along and cheer, when Eric Clapton plays "Layla"???  Anyway, it was a great evening! A wonderful show! I loved it. Now I am back home, and I finished learning for Biology. Yay, 50 Din. 4 sites to memorize.... Now it's time to learn history... *sobs* I hate learning!
1	the people who live  in this building...occasionally make me doubt their intelligence.  There is a frat boy screaming "rain god" outside my window.  this makes me happy, in a way, because it is raining...and it smells fantastic. very wet earth, and all that.  went and saw Jester last night...y'all should go.  very interesting transition from farce to tragedy, and a mixture of the two forms.  Lauren D. Webb pulls off her role quite well...growing in to the role by the second act.   The guy who plays Saquer Quersh is also fantastic...a great physical actor and a good sense for delivering his lines.  just getting going on my day here...i know.  coffee cake is in the oven, and i happen to be pretty damn happy.  -b
0	thanksgiving was good till about an hr ago i got another speeding ticket. damn pig was hiding in the dark. i was going 81 in a 65. im gonna take Defensive driving...i'm really low on money too. couldnt have happened at a better time. looks like i wont be buying food or anything for a while. just hope i can save up enough to buy christmas presents. i'm not going to tell my parents just yet, eventhough i should...they would kill me. everything has been going to shit lately. last week i was sick miss 3 day of school... so now i have missed 6 days this term so i'll probly be on attendence probation. i missed a day of work too. i have 2 weeks left on this term...Christmas is coming up...i just feel like shit right now. i dont know its wierd. im just really unhappy with everything right now...when will i be happy again?
1	After the rollercoaster I mistakenly rode earlier this week, I figured that I better do some research into the basics.    A co-worker got me this book for my 30th birthday a couple of years ago…  The Evolution of Desire  by Prof. David M. Buss   Discord and dissolution in mating relationships are typically seen as sings of failure.  They are regarded as distortions or perversions of the natural state of married life.  They are thought to signal personal inadequacy, immaturity, neurosis, failure of will, or simply poor judgment in the choice of a mate.  His view is radically wrong.  Conflict in mating is the norm and not the exception. 
1	okay so i just realized that a.)i have no friends b.)no one ever comments in my journal so i think it might be time i stop writing in it c.)i have a math test tommorow d.)i didnt read for english....  alright so american idol countdown.. 26 MINTUES  days till im 18: 23
1	quote of the night: "i couldn't close the door cuz my ass got in the way" haha No H that was great....so i didnt do a lot today, just some shopping with jess and ray. then i went to panera for dinner with mike. then i just hung out in the room. not to long ago, Jess, Money, and No H came in with there "new cleavage" they are crazy, but it def wouldnt be the same without them. its almost Lauren's bday, at midnight. HAPPY BIRTHDAY LAUR!!!! thats about it for now, i just think everyone should know the other quote of the day is "all actions have reactions" Laur!
0	I held my first solitary ritual ever, last night. I had to do dishes and take out the trash first but then I looked up at the moon and I just knew, it was time. It's kind of strange. All my calenders said Wedensday was the full moon but last night felt so much more magickal. I got everything ready but I couldn't think of anything to do the ritual for. If I have no purpose, I don't know which God/dess to call so I just called the elements and asked for serenity in my daily life. I felt fine until Nick refused to help carry out the cakes and wine for the birds and trees. I know it's such a silly thing to get mad over and kills what little point there was to the ritual. It just seems like I push him t do everything. I push him to look for a job, go to bed on time, go to school (when he was going) and now I push hm to finish rituals he started with me?! I just feel like I'm sharing my passion and I don't even have enough for me.

1	  ben + piglet = twu luv    Anyway, I was thinking about how poorly written and cliche those trashy romance novels that my mother likes to read are, and I was thinking about how  anyone  could produce such mindless and useless drivel, when I thought that hey,  I  could write crap like that.  If they can, so can I!  ...So yeah, that's my new life ambition.  In addition to getting as far as I possibly can in life while exerting the minimal amount of effort possible, I will also be a trashy romance novelist.   That means I can use cheesy euphemisms like  throbbing python of love  and etc.   My Neopets are, like, dying...and I randomly have a ham and cheese omelette in my inventory and I don't know why...   This  is totally  random  XD
1	i just wanted to say that i am sorry that i missed your birthday.  i hope it was nice.  things are going good around here.  my dad is mowing the lawn, benny is sleeping on the couch & mama is picking up her smooshed pumpkin.  i hope you are doing well.  love,   winston
1	We just bought 3 days 2nights in Daytona, 3 d 2 n in Fort Lauderdale, 4 d 3 n in Orlando (with disney or universal tickets) 3 d 2 n in Williamsburg VA and 4 d 3 n in Las Vegas for.....  300 Bucks!! I love phone sales people. And we can use them any time between now and 2008. We do, of course, have to pay for air fair, but thats still cheap for 2 people in hotels for a total of 13 nights.   I applied to work at the scariest greenhouse ive ever seen today. It was a warehouse, wholesale plants. The guy was so redneck it was crazy. I hope I dont get that job.

0	    Everything comes undone. Everything is meant to be. NOTHING lasts forever.....  I've hit a rut in life.  The more I stand still, the more pain I face. I feel as if I'm destined to hurt. I can't move forward, because I'm too weak. I'm unable to handle something so huge.  I can't even be myself anymore.!  I wish there was someone to talk to.  
0	I can't wait to leave  I"m tired of hurting.  People can be really nasty.   I wish things in my personal life could stay personal.  I feel like my life is an open book for all to read.     "you can even ask Lindsey N, she pratically told the entire Jazz choir"
1	The Civil Union bill passed it's second reading... by 10 votes - but that was a greater majority than the prositution reform bill.   This is awesome from the point of view of anti-discrimination, equal rights and human rights.   though the bill denoting the 'nature' of a relationship, and is key to the legal rights of these unions, is being held up at the moment.   Love it or hate it, you can't deny that this is a huge issue, and one that is causing major division as Kiwi's sort out what side of the fence they're on. But it's definitely been an interesting year from the political side of things.
0	I guess I'm just generally unhappy. there is a lot i could talk about now. But i'm just sad. for no reason. but i have no reason not to be.   I might get a new computer because mine is a piece of shit.  i need to eat food.  Please call me tonight. i feel kind of alone.
1	It's time for Laura's to go to bed now, but I'm so excited cause I get to see my Adam twice this summer!!!! YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So I'm going to GA to look at grad schools in a couple weeks and he's going to come up for my birthday.  I'm super dooper excited :).  Anywho, I need to get some sleep or I'll be a grumpy girl in the morning.  Nighty night all!

0	A moment of silence, please, for the good doctor...   
0	I just checked the weather for Friday, and... IT'S SUPPOSED TO RAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO 61 DEGREES?!?!?!?! I'm so sad now! I don't want to practice from 5:00-7:00. As much as I love late practices, I WANT TO BE OUTSIDE!!!!!!!!!!!! This is so depressing.
1	I'm single also. Kinda sad, but i knew it would happen eventually (rather soon), i had to just get it overwith. I couldn't take it. I'm hoping that we can still be friends but if not oh well, i'll survive. Life goes on. nothing else is really new. Same boring life. Though i can't wait till the David Meece concert at my church this Sunday!!!! Meece is really cool, he's a good christian pianist/singer. Well, Hello to everyone, again.
0	The hearing is over I have to wait 10 days for a ruling .. it was such a bad experience .. I honestly would not wish it on anyone .. the judge gave no indication as to which way he was leaning which makes me nervous .. I guess I can't do anything about it now ..   I've decided not to post anymore unless it's something positive .. I am sick of complaining even I don't want to hear about it anymore .. with that being said I hope/pray I am able to post something soon ..
1	I feel a great floppety-flop in my heart and ,NO,not because I'm  nervous but because I'm so happy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure my best friend  is at her grandmother's house by now and I am simply waiting for her to  call.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her grandmother lives right down the  road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be so good to visit in person once  again.&nbsp;&nbsp; And Joseph will quit going around moping cuz now he  CAN have P.J. over to stay.&nbsp; He was so worried he might not want  to come.      I am sorta in the dark about New Years Eve.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know  what we have planned but i'm sure it will be fun.&nbsp; My big brother  is coming down todat and he will probably be here around 12-or  1.&nbsp;&nbsp; He will be bringing his POTC special edition DVD for us  to watch and Mama will be making some more Christmas punch and lemon  chess pies so it shouldn't be too boring tonight. 
0	Well yesterday Kelly visited yesterday so we all decided to go cosmic bowling. Well I was getting extremely bored so I called Rachel and we ended up hanging out at her house at like 6. So I got there it was Rachel, Kellly, Jason, and Stu. We watched some movies ate some food and then left. We got there and everyone that went was Me, Kelly, Rachel, Jason, Stu, Julie, and Scott. That was really fun and I had a great time! Well I was having a great time until i got home. It seems like something always comes back to me and brings my mood way way down. Well now I'm sitting at my house all by my lonesome bored as fuk!
0	i was going to go pick up cat because i havent seen her in a while, and  instead of going to her place my car decides to nail a curb goin about  15mph. rim is very cracked, it will be flat in the morning. took some  pics of the undercarriage and suspension to check for bent/broken  parts, but i cant find my usb cable to get the pics onto my computer  for a good close up look. once i find that cable i will post pics. did  i mention i lost my job and my other vehicle this week too?        what   the  fuck.    
1	I went to the Nintendo Fusion Tour yesterday. It was pretty damn good. The first band up was Cauterize. They pretty much blew. They sucked so much that I was playing black jack on my cell phone during most of their act. Then came Revis. They were okay. Not a band I want to see again. After them, came Cold. I was petty disapoined in their set. They still rocked, put they could've played SadHappy, Wasted Years, or End of the World. Then finally Evanescence came on. They were so fucking awesome. They opened up with "Haunted" which is one my favorite songs. They did a cover of The Smashing Pumpkins's "Zero" which was really awesome. They basically played every song from their album. "Bring Me to Life" wa great live. For an encore, Amy came out and played "My Immortal" on a piano. Amy is so hot by the way, hehe. At the end of te concert, I caught Rocky Gray's (drummer of Evanescence) drum stick. It's so cool.  Well I'm gonna get of here. Talking to Denise and all. Laterz  ~Koka
1	In about 7hrs I will get to see "JET" again, I can't wait. I hope this show is as good as New York.  So I was watching VH1 and they were showing something about Famous Hot Couples, and on the background Flickerstick was in the background, it was Beautiful, that is so awesome!!! I got so excited, but then again I am a dork!!  Today is my day off and I did try to go apartment hunting, and I did check out 1, but it really didn't catch my eye. I just my sis if worse comes to worse, we should just stay where we are at, just because we really don't have enough time, and we do like where we live so that is probably what is going to happen.  About Thursday, I am seriously thinking about just going in my car. The only reason I wanted to catch a ride with my friend, was so I could ride back with Natalie. It is still up in the air.   "LIck Me ALL OF YOU"!!!!(Sorry I have been watching Dazed and Confused)

What the F?   So after begging the technology head he removed it from the "bad" list and I can read and post without going over to my friends apartment or the public library!   *Happy Dance*
0	I would like to start by saying if you haven't figured it out that i just put down what i feel.The last so ever days i have not felt good....mentaly.I realized that i don't think i will feel good for a long time or untill she returns to me once again.I am sorry for any type of feeling disruptmen i have caused to those i care about.Inside i will be unhappy everyday untill i can see her once again.People are prolly getting sick of my moppy ass writing about all this so idk maybe i'll only type when i'm happy which won't be for a long while.so untill next time (when ever that may be)
1	Son Kite is  THE  ultimate Minimalist Trance Group! LoL, I'm going all poseurish with my weird music group obsessions.
0	alright well the last two days back at school have been nuts.   Ive had classes and work back in full swing. I have to work my ass off these last 7 weeks!   Ive also been in the gym  -3 miles on the elliptical in about 27/28 minutes -15 min warm up on the treadmill (aka the devil) - Little abs, and arms after that  My diet has been low carb and high protein. I miss sugar and fat already! :P ive only been on it 3 days!   Im not really sure about the bikini contest. I think its worth a shot at 500 bucks!!!   &lt;3 Christie  P.S. Joe is in Florida :D He got me a gift at Epcot Center today! I cant wait  Now to lay on my bed and read BAZAAR
0	All thats left is 2 red envelopes, a fleeting memories, and a few gifts from the aunts. Thats what happens when people come and go in such a short time. It was fun while it lasted though.  Anna, Aunt, and Aunt #2 were here from saturday night to this morning... I miss them. In loving memory of them I wore eye liner today... And no they're not dead...
1	Less than a week till band camp. I can't wait. The homewood trip is going to kick some serious ass. It'll be way better than last year. Yep. Woooooooooo
1	   Neighbor Kitty (Doesn't something about this kitty just scream "Pet me!")   I couldn’t sleep so I took pictures of 6am. They aren't that great because I missed sunrise by about a half hour. But when I was taking pictures all the kitties ran over to me (along with Mr. Peacock) and demanded attention and I was petting Willow and Neighbor Kitty when they got in a fight and I had to push Willow with my foot to get her away. I picked up Neighbor Kitty because he was all upset and he gave me a big kitty hug. That made me so happy. He purred away.  My TMJ is really bad because of the Levaquin. It really hurts to talk. Owie.  I wanted to pick this flower for Jay, but since he's not here the flower gets to live.         Hehe, I can hear the chickies cheeping at the morning.
0	Today has been a pretty terrible day already.  I went to get my taxes done after cleaning out my car and cleaning up my room.  My return is only $160 from the feds, and I owe the state of LA $9.  The cost of getting them done was $74.  I'm not entirely sure the guy who did my taxes did them right, he was old and tottering.  Regardless, I'm sure he thought I was insane because I started crying when I found out this shitty news, and I walked out of JacksonHewitt crying.  This is entirely bad news, because I am used to getting back several hundred dollars from the feds and at least a hundred from LA.  I have NEVER owed money on my taxes.  I am going to take a street car ride
1	  I did almost no studying today.&nbsp; And I'm not going to either.&nbsp; I've done a lot this week so today I'm chillin.&nbsp; And watching Family Guy.&nbsp; Take that conscience cricket!!! &nbsp;:p&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;I'll do school&nbsp;work all of this weekend.&nbsp; I promise.       I'm really stoked about the upcoming trips.&nbsp; I love roadtrips!!!!!!!!!!!   
0	I talked to Landon Moore, and hes my ex so that was kinda wierd but he is always really fun to talk to, I kinda still have feelings for him, but never really anything serious, just crazy old ex girlfriend feelings LoL! But ne ways, i feel like I am on the outside of everything... Everytime i get closer to someone they ditch me for their best friend or i am always second to their priorities I guess. I saw my other Ex boyfriend Chaz, he was showing everyone his new pics from millitary ball with his new girlfriend, and again I am on the outside, even Travis had pics made at military ball with some girl. It really hurts, I am not included, and I try i really do but it doesnt matter because ill always be just second best, this kills me!!! I hate being a lone  *Terah*
1	...chewing gum I hate the most.   http://movies.yahoo.com/movies/feat ure/charlieandthechocolatefactory.html   Click it.  Watch it.  Love it.  Though I love Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I thought that the book was butchered in ways that it shouldn't have been.  In this one, I believe Tim Burton and Johnny Depp can pull off at least a little bit of a better adaptation.  I am so excited.

0	Why do people always suffer about things ? I mean... one can't change it... you have to accept it.. You can treasure the beloved time... but there's always an end.. and I think every human being have to let go someday... I know, it's painful. Maybe there is a solution... I hope it for these people. But why do always my beloved suffer ? I mean.. I can't do anything , but to be there for them. Sometimes very frustrating. I'm sorry that I can't do anything. I hope that time will heal the wounds. Recently people change here. But why ? I think... why can't that all going on like before ?  Maybe too much to wish at the moment. yes.. so ganbatte~ and.. don't be so depressed .. life is going on.
0	I'm just so depressed right now! All the efforts doesn't seem to pay off. I'm so disappointed with the results of my thesis. My body's already deteriorating and my brain's all cranked up. Yet all I got were mean comments and low grades from my bitch professor. Damn!
1	I'm getting  Standing Ovations 2 . It's been ordered. Awesome. Jai and Cheyenne kissing. dasfdsdfgsdg. And Popular...ha. My friend and I were singing that today. And songs from Avenue Q. "You can't put your finger there!"... "Put your finger there!!"
1	Oh yeah!  And Happy Birthday to Kurt!  I hope it's a good year for you, I really do.
0	The vet said that my cat will have to be put to sleep. He's got a stomach tumor and can't eat or drink anything. He's so old that there really isn't anything they can do for him. It's a tough decision but I guess it has to be made. He's lived a long and happy life though(17 years). I'll sure miss having him around.
0	Last night around breaktime (that's about 9:00) I got an email from Project Embrace. Evidently they're ending it for this school year because the director quit for family reasons, though I suspected something might be up after last week's fiasco (when I was the only one there). I figured come graduation time I would be fine with moving on, but it feels like I've been robbed. I have a lump in my throat because I feel like I'll never see my kids again, and it's an unfair feeling.   I'm going on Wednesday for the last time. I honestly don't know what I'm going to do after this...I suppose eat my soup and come home. I've got data to enter for themoment...hope the day gets better. Get my genetics test back tonight =( Adios.
0	I wish I knew what some people were thinking.  I think i'm striving for something more than what I have.  Feeling kind of bleh. Wish I could speak my mind, but too scared.

1	After a too-long hiatus, the opinion duel between The New Republic and National Review has returned, this time as a general row about conservative vs. liberal economic policy.  A little while back I posted Johnathan Chait's original column that sparked this debate ( http://www.livejournal.com/users/mervl urker/16212.html ), along with the Michael Perentz column that Goldberg notes in his response ( http://www.livejournal.com/users/mervl urker/16066.html?mode=reply ).  Anyway, I really like these "debates" that folks from these two mags get into.   http://www.opinionduel.com/

0	So...seems like a nice place here. The walls are a little bare, and the carpet could use a good shampooing, but what the hell, I'll take it.  GOD, am I ever not in the right headspace to be making my first post. I'm depressed, headachey, and hungry.  Work sucked, and I think I may be getting laid off for lack of stuff to do.  Stuff on the mud sucked, and I feel like I'm neglecting my house and my apprentice.  Worst of all, I had a pretty unpleasant experience with Lucy and the lovely couple/triad we've been romancing. (Not that they're available for romance, mind you, but it sure as hell seems like we've been romancing them anyway. Neat trick, no?). It was all my fault and I feel like shit, and it caused a fight between Lucy and I, and it generally blew.  We're going to eat leftover omlet bits and a salad and see about patching thing up with these folks.  I REALLLY like them.    Oh, for those of you out there who enjoy a good link, here's  one . Okay,  two . I'm feeling generous.
1	woohooo  i had a jobs fair in queens this morning so i went, expecting to pop my head in then leave again. got talkting to staff from the hospital i want to work in and they asked me to go for an interview, i wasnt ready at all but i thought i would give it a go cause if it went wrong i could do it again at another time  finished the interview and one of the girls said to me 'we would like to offer u a provisional post' depending on occupational healths and my PECs check and stuff of course  they also said they would try and get me into the gynae ward which is where i want to be going, and if not there then theatres which is cool also :D  woohooooo
1	As of March 17 (Happy St. Patrick's Day, by the way), 2005.  NYU: pending BC: pending UNH: pending UConn: pending Binghamton: ACCEPTED!! got the email today :D  more to come when I find out.  I always told myself Iwouldn't be that guy announcing every acceptance or reject on LJ, and I probably won't cause I never remember to update this thing, but honestly, there is nothing else write-worthy going on in my life, so deal.

Now I get to drive myself to work through rush hour! Yay!  They don't take checks though, so they just gave me the bill of sale and said to bring the cash in the morning when I come to pick up the car.  It's greeeeeen :D  Strange color for a car, but as long as it drives... lol.

0	i did have fun, but this weekend didn't quite live up to my hopes. i think it was a combination of last night (not you, emily, but you know, the other thing) and the fact that i really do hate my parents for everything they've done to me. the day i never have to speak to any of them again will be the happiest day of my life.  i'm really tired, and i think i'm getting sick. i have that feeling that i did after The Night of Vodka, where i was depressed and didn't want to see or talk to anybody for a week at least. maybe that's what alcohol does to me. i don't know. this weather isn't helping any, that's for sure.  it sucks, because i was in the best mood driving back from austin yesterday, just flying along the highway and listening to the good life while em snored away next to me. haha.   ughhh. i feel like shit. and of course i have to go to work.
0	 Got this from       ls56   . Richard Biggs, who played Dr. Franklin on the TV series Babylon 5, has passed away.  Lara posted  a few links about this.     For those who still haven't seen this show, I implore you to check it out as soon as possible. It's simply one of the most amazing artistic creations of our time.
0	You know i really try so hard! god! i just hate myself! im trying so hard to change my life around but nothing works! I'm still fat, i'm still stupid, i'm still lonely, and i'm still paranoid.  I'm sure it's no big thing but my gut instict tells me that it is. I really wish i'd just die, right now, on the spot. I woke up this morning singing for the first time in forever and now it's like well.... fuck.
